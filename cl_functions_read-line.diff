 Arguments and Values

 input-stream - an input stream designator. The default is standard input.
 eof-error-p - a generalized boolean. The default is true.
  eof-value - an object. The default is nil.
 recursive-p - a generalized boolean. The default is false.
 line - a string or the eof-value.
 missing-newline-p - a generalized boolean.
 Description

 Reads from input-stream a line of text that is terminated by a newline or end of file.
  If recursive-p is true, this call is expected to be embedded in a higher-level call to read or a similar function used by the Lisp reader.
 The primary value, line, is the line that is read, represented as a string (without the trailing newline, if any). If eof-error-p is false and the end of file for input-stream is reached before any characters are read, eof-value is returned as the line.
-The secondary value, missing-newline-p, is a generalized boolean that is false if the line was terminated by a newline, or true if the line was terminated by the end of file for input-stream (or if the line is the eof-value).
+The secondary value, missing-newline-p, is a generalized boolean that is false if the line was terminated by a newline, or true if the line was terminated by the end of file for input-stream
+(or if the line is the eof-value).

- (read-line input-stream nil nil)
