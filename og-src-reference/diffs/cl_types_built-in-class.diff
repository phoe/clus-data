 Description

-A built-in class is a class whose instances have restricted capabilities or special representations. Attempting to use defclass to define subclasses of a built-in class signals an error of type error. Calling make-instance to create an instance of a built-in class signals an error of type error. Calling slot-value on an instance of a built-in class signals an error of type error. Redefining a built-in class or using change-class to change the class of an instance to or from a built-in class signals an error of type error. However, built-in classes can be used as parameter specializers in methods.
