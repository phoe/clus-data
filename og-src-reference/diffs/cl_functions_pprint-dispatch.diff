 Syntax


-pprint-dispatch object &optional table => function, found-p
+ pprint-dispatch object &optional table → function, found-p

 Arguments and Values

-object - an object.
-table - a pprint dispatch table, or nil. The default is the value of *print-pprint-dispatch*.
-function - a function designator.
-found-p - a generalized boolean.
+* object - an object.
+* table - a pprint dispatch table, or nil. The default is the value of *print-pprint-dispatch*.
+* function - a function designator.
+* found-p - a generalized boolean.
### "*" added in CLUS
 Description

 Retrieves the highest priority function in table that is associated with a type specifier that matches object. The function is chosen by finding all of the type specifiers in table that match the object and selecting the highest priority function associated with any of these type specifiers. If there is more than one highest priority function, an arbitrary choice is made. If no type specifiers match the object, a function is returned that prints object  using print-object.
 The secondary value, found-p, is true if a matching type specifier was found in table, or false otherwise.
 If table is nil, retrieval is done in the initial pprint dispatch table.
