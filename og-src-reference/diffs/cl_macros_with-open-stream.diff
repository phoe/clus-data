 Arguments and Values

 var - a variable name.
 stream - a form; evaluated to produce a stream.
 declaration - a declare expression; not evaluated.
 forms - an implicit progn.
 results - the values returned by the forms.
 Description

 with-open-stream performs a series of operations on stream, returns a value, and then closes the stream.
-Var is bound to the value of stream, and then forms are executed as an implicit progn. stream is automatically closed on exit from with-open-stream, no matter whether the exit is normal or abnormal.  The stream has dynamic extent; its extent ends when the form is exited.
