 Arguments and Values
  
 condition-form - a form; evaluated to produce a condition. 
 condition - a condition object resulting from the evaluation of condition-form. 
 restart-form - a form; evaluated to produce a restart-list. 
 restart-list - a list of restart objects resulting from the evaluation of restart-form. 
-forms - an implicit progn; evaluated. 
+ forms - an implicit progn; evaluated..
 results - the values returned by forms. 
 Description
  
 First, the condition-form and restarts-form are evaluated in normal left-to-right order; the primary values yielded by these evaluations are respectively called the condition and the restart-list. 
-Next, the forms are evaluated in a dynamic environment in which each restart in restart-list is associated with the condition. See Section 9.1.4.2.4 (Associating a Restart with a Condition). 
-Examples None.
  
-Side Effects None.
  
-Affected By None.

 Notes
  
 Usually this macro is not used explicitly in code, since restart-case handles most of the common cases in a way that is syntactically more concise.
