+Syntax
+ / number → reciprocal
+ / numerator &rest denominators+ → quotient
+Arguments and Values
+ number, denominator - a non-zero number.
+ numerator, quotient, reciprocal - a number.
+Description
+The function / performs division or reciprocation.
+If no denominators are supplied, the function / returns the reciprocal of number.
+If at least one denominator is supplied, the function / divides the numerator by all of the denominators and returns the resulting quotient.
+If each argument is either an integer or a ratio, and the result is not an integer, then it is a ratio.
+The function / performs necessary type conversions.
+If any argument is a float then the rules of floating-point contagion apply; see section {\secref\FloatingPointComputations}.
+Examples
+(/ 12 4)
+→
+3

+13/4
+(/ -8)
+→

+(/ 3 4 5)
+→
+3/20
+(/ 0.5)
+→
+2.0
+(/ 20 5)
+→
+4
+(/ 5 20)
+→
+1/4
+(/ 60 -2 3 5.0)
+→
+-2.0
+(/ 2 #c(2 2))
+→
+#C(1/2 -1/2)
+Affected By
+None.
+Exceptional Situations
+The consequences are unspecified if any argument other than the first is zero. If there is only one argument, the consequences are unspecified if it is zero.
+Might signal type-error if some argument is not a number. Might signal division-by-zero if division by zero is attempted. Might signal arithmetic-error.
