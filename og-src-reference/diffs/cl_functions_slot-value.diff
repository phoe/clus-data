 Exceptional Situations

 If an attempt is made to read a slot and no slot of the name slot-name exists in the object, slot-missing is called as follows

- (slot-missing (class-of instance)
-               instance
-               slot-name
-               'slot-value)

-<TT>
+(slot-missing (class-of instance) instance slot-name 'slot-value)
  (If slot-missing is invoked, its primary value is returned by slot-value.)

- (slot-missing (class-of instance)
-               instance
-               slot-name

- The specific behavior depends on object's metaclass. An error is never signaled if object has metaclass standard-class. An error is always signaled if object has metaclass built-in-class. The consequences are unspecified if object has any other metaclass--an error might or might not be signaled in this situation. Note in particular that the behavior for conditions and structures is not specified.

 Notes

  Although no implementation is required to do so, implementors are strongly encouraged to implement the function slot-value using the function slot-value-using-class described in the Metaobject Protocol.
 Implementations may optimize slot-value by compiling it inline.
