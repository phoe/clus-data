 Arguments and Values

 character - a character.
 integer - a non-negative integer.
 Description

  Returns a non-negative integer encoding the character object. The manner in which the integer is computed is implementation-dependent. In contrast to sxhash, the result is not guaranteed to be independent of the particular Lisp image.
 If character has no implementation-defined attributes, the results of char-int and char-code are the same.

- (char= c1 c2) ==  (= (char-int c1) (char-int c2))
### Line moved to the notes

-<TT> for characters c1 and c2.
### Line removed from CLUS
