 Arguments and Values

  filespec - a pathname designator.
  truename - a physical pathname.
 Description

-truename tries to find the file indicated by filespec and returns its truename. If the filespec designator is an open stream, its associated file is used.  If filespec is a stream, truename can be used whether the stream is open or closed. It is permissible for truename to return more specific information after the stream is closed than when the stream was open.  If filespec is a pathname it represents the name used to open the file. This may be, but is not required to be, the actual name of the file.

 Exceptional Situations

-An error of type file-error is signaled if an appropriate file cannot be located within the file system for the given filespec,  or if the file system cannot perform the requested operation.

### Is this formating good?
   An error of type file-error is signaled if pathname is wild.
