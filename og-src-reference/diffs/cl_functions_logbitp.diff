 Arguments and Values

  index - a non-negative integer.
### Formating of above line
 integer - an integer.
 generalized-boolean - a generalized boolean.
 Description

-logbitp is used to test the value of a particular bit in integer, that is treated as if it were binary. The value of logbitp is true if the bit in integer whose index is index (that is, its weight is 2^index) is a one-bit; otherwise it is false.
+logbitp is used to test the value of a particular bit in integer, that is treated as if it were binary.
+The value of logbitp is true if the bit in integer whose index is index (that is, its weight is 2^index) is a one-bit; otherwise it is false.
 Negative integers are treated as if they were in two's-complement notation.
