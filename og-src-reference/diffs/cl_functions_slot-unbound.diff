 slot-unbound (class t) instance slot-name

 Arguments and Values

 class - the class of the instance.
 instance - the instance in which an attempt was made to read the unbound slot.
 slot-name - the name of the unbound slot.
 result - an object.
 Description

 The generic function slot-unbound is called when an unbound slot is read in an instance whose metaclass is standard-class. The default method signals an error  of type unbound-slot. The name slot of the unbound-slot condition is initialized to the name of the offending variable, and the instance slot of the unbound-slot condition is initialized to the offending instance.
- The generic function slot-unbound is not intended to be called by programmers. Programmers may write methods for it. The function slot-unbound is called only indirectly by slot-value.
- If slot-unbound returns, only the primary value will be used by the caller, and all other values will be ignored.
-Examples None.
