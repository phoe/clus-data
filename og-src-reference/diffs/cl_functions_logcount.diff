 Arguments and Values

 integer - an integer.
 number-of-on-bits - a non-negative integer.
 Description

-Computes and returns the number of bits in the two's-complement binary representation of integer that are `on' or `set'. If integer is negative, the 0 bits are counted; otherwise, the 1 bits are counted.
+Computes and returns the number of bits in the two's-complement binary representation of integer that are "on" or "set". If integer is negative, the 0 bits are counted; otherwise, the 1 bits are counted.

 Notes

 Even if the implementation does not represent integers internally in two's complement binary, logcount behaves as if it did.
 The following identity always holds

-    (logcount x)
- ==  (logcount (- (+ x 1)))
- ==  (logcount (lognot x))
