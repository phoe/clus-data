 implementation-dependent. 
 Description
  
 These constant variables provide a way for programs to examine the implementation-defined limits for the various float formats. 
-Of these variables, each which has ``-normalized'' in its name must have a value which is a normalized float, and each which does not have ``-normalized'' in its name may have a value which is either a normalized float or a denormalized float, as appropriate. 
-Of these variables, each which has ``short-float'' in its name must have a value which is a short float, each which has ``single-float'' in its name must have a value which is a single float, each which has ``double-float'' in its name must have a value which is a double float, and each which has ``long-float'' in its name must have a value which is a long float.

   most-positive-short-float, most-positive-single-float, most-positive-double-float, most-positive-long-float  
  Each of these constant variables has as its value the positive float of the largest magnitude (closest in value to, but not equal to, positive infinity) for the float format implied by its name.

  Each of these constant variables has as its value the smallest positive (nonzero) float for the float format implied by its name.

  Each of these constant variables has as its value the negative (nonzero) float of the smallest magnitude for the float format implied by its name. (If an implementation supports minus zero as a different object from positive zero, this value must not be minus zero.)
