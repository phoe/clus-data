 Arguments and Values
  
 name - a symbol; not evaluated. 
 function - a form; evaluated. 
 forms - an implicit progn. 
 interactive-function - a form; evaluated. 
 report-function - a form; evaluated. 
 test-function - a form; evaluated. 
 results - the values returned by the forms. 
 Description
  
 restart-bind executes the body of forms in a dynamic environment where restarts with the given names are in effect. 
 If a name is nil, it indicates an anonymous restart; if a name is a non-nil symbol, it indicates a named restart. 
 The function, interactive-function, and report-function are unconditionally evaluated in the current lexical and dynamic environment prior to evaluation of the body. Each of these forms must evaluate to a function. 
 If invoke-restart is done on that restart, the function which resulted from evaluating function is called, in the dynamic environment of the invoke-restart, with the arguments given to invoke-restart. The function may either perform a non-local transfer of control or may return normally. 
 If the restart is invoked interactively from the debugger (using invoke-restart-interactively), the arguments are defaulted by calling the function which resulted from evaluating interactive-function. That function may optionally prompt interactively on query I/O, and should return a list of arguments to be used by invoke-restart-interactively when invoking the restart. 
 If a restart is invoked interactively but no interactive-function is used, then an argument list of nil is used. In that case, the function must be compatible with an empty argument list. 
-If the restart is presented interactively (e.g., by the debugger), the presentation is done by calling the function which resulted from evaluating report-function. This function must be a function of one argument, a stream. It is expected to print a description of the action that the restart takes to that stream. This function is called any time the restart is printed while *print-escape* is nil.

This function is called any time the restart is printed while *print-escape* is nil.
 In the case of interactive invocation, the result is dependent on the value of interactive-function as follows. 
 interactive-function  
  Value is evaluated in the current lexical environment and should return a function of no arguments which constructs a list of arguments to be used by invoke-restart-interactively when invoking this restart. The function may prompt interactively using query I/O if necessary. 
 report-function  
- Value is evaluated in the current lexical environment and should return a function of one argument, a stream, which prints on the stream a summary of the action that this restart takes. This function is called whenever the restart is reported (printed while *print-escape* is nil). If no report-function option is provided, the manner in which the restart is reported is implementation-dependent.

 Notes
  
 restart-bind is primarily intended to be used to implement restart-case and might be useful in implementing other macros. Programmers who are uncertain about whether to use restart-case or restart-bind should prefer restart-case for the cases where it is powerful enough, using restart-bind only in cases where its full generality is really needed.
