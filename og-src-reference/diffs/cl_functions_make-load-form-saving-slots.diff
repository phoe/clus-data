 Arguments and Values

 object - an object.
 slot-names - a list.
 environment - an environment object.
 creation-form - a form.
 initialization-form - a form.
 Description

  Returns forms that, when evaluated, will construct an object equivalent to object, without executing initialization forms. The slots in the new object that correspond to initialized slots in object are initialized using the values from object. Uninitialized slots in object are not initialized in the new object. make-load-form-saving-slots works for any instance of standard-object or structure-object.
 Slot-names is a list of the names of the slots to preserve. If slot-names is not supplied, its value is all of the local slots.
 make-load-form-saving-slots returns two values, thus it can deal with circular structures. Whether the result is useful in an application depends on whether the object's type and slot contents fully capture the application's idea of the object's state.
 Environment is the environment in which the forms will be processed.

 Notes

 make-load-form-saving-slots can be useful in user-written make-load-form methods.

  When the object is an instance of standard-object, make-load-form-saving-slots could return a creation form that calls allocate-instance and an initialization form that contains calls to setf of slot-value and slot-makunbound, though other functions of similar effect might actually be used.
