 signed-byte [s | *]

 Compound Type Specifier Arguments

 s - a positive integer.
 Compound Type Specifier Description

-This denotes the set of integers that can be represented in two's-complement form in a byte of s bits. This is equivalent to (integer -2^s-1 2^s-1-1). The type signed-byte or the type (signed-byte *) is the same as the type integer.

+This denotes the set of integers that can be represented in two's-complement form in a byte of s bits. This is equivalent to (integer lower upper), where lower and upper, respectively, are -2s - 1 and 2s - 1 - 1. The type signed-byte or the type (signed-byte *) is the same as the type integer.
### CLHS "This is equivalent to (integer -2^s-1 2^s-1-1)."
### CLUS "This is equivalent to (integer lower upper), where lower and upper, respectively, are -2s - 1 and 2s - 1 - 1."
### Should be "-2^s - 1 and 2^s - 1 - 1."
