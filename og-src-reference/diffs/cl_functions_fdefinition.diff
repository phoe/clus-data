 Arguments and Values

 function-name - a function name.  In the non-setf case, the name must be fbound in the global environment.
 definition - Current global function definition named by function-name.
 new-definition - a function.
 Description

-fdefinition accesses the current global function definition named by function-name. The definition may be a function or may be an object representing a special form or macro.  The value returned by fdefinition when fboundp returns true but the function-name denotes a macro or special form is not well-defined, but fdefinition does not signal an error.
-Examples None.

-Side Effects None.

 Exceptional Situations

 Should signal an error of type type-error if function-name is not a function name.
 An error of type undefined-function is signaled in the non-setf case if function-name is not fbound.

 Notes

 fdefinition cannot access the value of a lexical function name produced by flet or labels; it can access only the global function value.
-setf can be used with fdefinition to replace a global function definition when the function-name's function definition does not represent a special form.  setf of fdefinition requires a function as the new value. It is an error to set the fdefinition of a function-name to a symbol, a list, or the value returned by fdefinition on the name of a macro or special form.
