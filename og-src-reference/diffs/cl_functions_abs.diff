 Arguments and Values

 number - a number.
 absolute-value - a non-negative real.
 Description

 abs returns the absolute value of number.
 If number is  a real,  the result is of the same type as number.
-If number is a complex, the result is a positive  real  with the same magnitude as number. The result can be a float even if number's components are rationals and an exact rational result would have been possible. Thus the result of (abs #c(3 4)) can be either 5 or 5.0, depending on the implementation.

- (abs 0) =>  0
- (abs 12/13) =>  12/13
- (abs -1.09) =>  1.09
- (abs #c(5.0 -5.0)) =>  7.071068
- (abs #c(5 5)) =>  7.071068
- (abs #c(3/5 4/5)) =>  1 or approximately 1.0
- (eql (abs -0.0) -0.0) =>  true

 Notes

 If number is a complex, the result is equivalent to the following
-(sqrt (+ (expt (realpart number) 2) (expt (imagpart number) 2)))
+(abs number) ≡ (sqrt (+ (expt (realpart number) 2) (expt (imagpart number) 2)))
### Changed code
 An implementation should not use this formula directly for all complexes but should handle very large or very small components specially to avoid intermediate overflow or underflow.
