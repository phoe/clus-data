 unsigned-byte [s | *]

 Compound Type Specifier Arguments

 s - a positive integer.
 Compound Type Specifier Description

-This denotes the set of non-negative integers that can be represented in a byte of size s (bits). This is equivalent to (mod m) for m=2^s, or to (integer 0 n) for n=2^s-1. The type unsigned-byte or the type (unsigned-byte *) is the same as the type (integer 0 *), the set of non-negative integers.
+This denotes the set of non-negative integers that can be represented in a byte of size s (bits). This is equivalent to (mod m) for m = 2s, or to (integer 0 n) for n = 2s - 1. The type unsigned-byte or the type (unsigned-byte *) is the same as the type (integer 0 *), the set of non-negative integers.
### Should be "n = 2^s - 1"
 Notes

 The type (unsigned-byte 1) is also called bit.
