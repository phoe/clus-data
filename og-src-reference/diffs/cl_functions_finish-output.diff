 Arguments and Values

 output-stream - an output stream designator. The default is standard output.
 Description

 finish-output, force-output, and clear-output exercise control over the internal handling of buffered stream output.
 finish-output attempts to ensure that any buffered output sent to output-stream has reached its destination, and then returns.
 force-output initiates the emptying of any internal buffers but does not wait for completion or acknowledgment to return.
 clear-output attempts to abort any outstanding output operation in progress in order to allow as little output as possible to continue to the destination.
-If any of these operations does not make sense for output-stream, then it does nothing. The precise actions of these functions are implementation-dependent.
