 Arguments and Values

 internal-time - a non-negative integer.
 Description

-get-internal-real-time returns as an integer the current time in internal time units, relative to an arbitrary time base. The difference between the values of two calls to this function is the amount of elapsed real time (i.e., clock time) between the two calls.
-Examples None.

-Side Effects None.
