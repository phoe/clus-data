### BIG differences. This is diff of two wrong files,
### CLUS "Function COMPLEX" and CLHS topic selection http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/doc/CommonLISP/HyperSpec/Body/any_complex.html
### CLUS style changed a lot

+ complex realpart &optional imagpart â†’ complex
+====Arguments and Values====
+* realpart - a real.
+* imagpart - a real.
+* complex - a rational or a complex.
+====Description====
+complex returns a number whose real part is realpart and whose imaginary part is imagpart.
+If realpart is a rational and imagpart is the rational number zero, the result of complex is realpart, a rational. Otherwise, the result is a complex.
+If either realpart or imagpart is a float, the non-float is converted to a float before the complex is created. If imagpart is not supplied, the imaginary part is a zero of the same type as realpart; i.e. (coerce 0 (type-of realpart)) is effectively used.
+Type upgrading implies a movement upwards in the type hierarchy lattice.
+In the case of complexes, the type-specifier must be a subtype of (upgraded-complex-part-type type-specifier). If type-specifier1 is a subtype of type-specifier2, then (upgraded-complex-element-type 'type-specifier1) must also be a subtype of (upgraded-complex-element-type 'type-specifier2). Two disjoint types can be upgraded into the same thing. #| TODO fix this sentence, it doesn't make sense here. |#
