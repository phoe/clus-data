 Syntax


-terpri &optional output-stream => nil
+ terpri &optional output-stream → nil
+ fresh-line &optional output-stream → generalized-boolean

-fresh-line &optional output-stream => generalized-boolean

 Arguments and Values

-output-stream -- an output stream designator. The default is standard output.
+ output-stream - an output stream designator. The default is standard output.
### CLHS "--" CLUS "-"
 generalized-boolean - a generalized boolean.
 Description

 terpri outputs a newline to output-stream.
 fresh-line is similar to terpri but outputs a newline only if the output-stream is not already at the start of a line. If for some reason this cannot be determined, then a newline is output anyway. fresh-line returns true if it outputs a newline; otherwise it returns false.
