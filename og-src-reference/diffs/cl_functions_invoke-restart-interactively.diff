 Arguments and Values

 restart - a restart designator.
 results - the values returned by the function associated with restart, if that function returns.
 Description

 invoke-restart-interactively calls the function associated with restart, prompting for any necessary arguments. If restart is a name, it must be valid in the current dynamic environment.
  invoke-restart-interactively prompts for arguments by executing the code provided in the interactive keyword to restart-case or interactive-function keyword to restart-bind.
 If no such options have been supplied in the corresponding restart-bind or restart-case, then the consequences are undefined if the restart takes required arguments. If the arguments are optional, an argument list of nil is used.
  Once the arguments have been determined, invoke-restart-interactively executes the following

  (apply #'invoke-restart restart arguments)

-<TT>
 Examples


- (defun add3 (x) (check-type x number) (+ x 3))
+(defun add3 (x)
+  (check-type x number)
+  (+ x 3))
+→
+ADD3

  (add3 'seven)
->>  Error The value SEVEN was not of type NUMBER.
->>  To continue, type CONTINUE followed by an option number
->>   1 Specify a different value to use.
->>   2 Return to Lisp Toplevel.
->>  Debug> (invoke-restart-interactively 'store-value)
->>  Type a form to evaluate and use 7
-=>  10

 Side Effects

 If prompting for arguments is necesary, some typeout may occur (on query I/O).
 A non-local transfer of control might be done by the restart.
 Affected By

 *query-io*, active restarts
 Exceptional Situations

 If restart is not valid, an error of type control-error is signaled.

 Notes

 invoke-restart-interactively is used internally by the debugger and may also be useful in implementing other portable, interactive debugging tools.
