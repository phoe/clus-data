 The warning condition is signaled
 While the warning condition is being signaled, the muffle-warning restart is established for use by a handler. If invoked, this restart bypasses further action by warn, which in turn causes warn to immediately return nil.
 If no handler for the warning condition is found
 If no handlers for the warning condition are found, or if all such handlers decline, then the condition is reported to error output by warn in an implementation-dependent format.
-nil is returned
+**[[CLConstant Variablesnil]]** is returned
### Is this line good?
 The value returned by warn if it returns is nil.
