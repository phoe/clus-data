### CLHS "standard ~T format directive" CLUS "standard ~T"
 The arguments colnum and colinc correspond to the two parameters to ~T and are in terms of ems. The kind argument specifies the style of tabbing. It must be one of line (tab as by ~T), section (tab as by ~T, but measuring horizontal positions relative to the start of the dynamically enclosing section), line-relative (tab as by ~@T), or section-relative (tab as by ~@T, but measuring horizontal positions relative to the start of the dynamically enclosing section).
