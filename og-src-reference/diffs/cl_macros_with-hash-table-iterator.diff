 Arguments and Values

 name - a name suitable for the first argument to macrolet.
 hash-table - a form, evaluated once, that should produce a hash table.
 declaration - a declare expression; not evaluated.
 forms - an implicit progn.
 results - the values returned by forms.
 Description

 Within the lexical scope of the body, name is defined via macrolet such that successive invocations of (name) return the items, one by one, from the hash table that is obtained by evaluating hash-table only once.
 An invocation (name) returns three values as follows
-1.  A generalized boolean that is true if an entry is returned. 2.  The key from the hash-table entry. 3.  The value from the hash-table entry. After all entries have been returned by successive invocations of (name), then only one value is returned, namely nil.
+ 1. A generalized boolean that is true if an entry is returned.
+ 2. The key from the hash-table entry.
+ 3. The value from the hash-table entry.
+After all entries have been returned by successive invocations of (name), then only one value is returned, namely nil.
 It is unspecified what happens if any of the implicit interior state of an iteration is returned outside the dynamic extent of the with-hash-table-iterator form such as by returning some closure over the invocation form.
 Any number of invocations of with-hash-table-iterator can be nested, and the body of the innermost one can invoke all of the locally established macros, provided all of those macros have distinct names.

 Examples

 The following function should return t on any hash table, and signal an error if the usage of with-hash-table-iterator does not agree with the corresponding usage of maphash.
