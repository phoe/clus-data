 Description

-The type print-not-readable consists of error conditions that occur during output while *print-readably* is true, as a result of attempting to write a printed representation with the Lisp printer that would not be correctly read back with the Lisp reader. The object which could not be printed is initialized by the objectinitialization argument to make-condition, and is accessed by the function print-not-readable-object.
