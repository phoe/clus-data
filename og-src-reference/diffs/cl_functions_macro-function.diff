### Line above changed in CLUS

 Exceptional Situations

  The consequences are undefined if environment is non-nil in a use of setf of macro-function.

 Notes

 setf can be used with macro-function to install a macro as a symbol's global function definition

  (setf (macro-function symbol) fn)

-<TT> The value installed must be a function that accepts two arguments, the entire macro call and an environment, and computes the expansion for that call. Performing this operation causes symbol to have only that macro definition as its global function definition; any previous definition, whether as a macro or as a function, is lost.
