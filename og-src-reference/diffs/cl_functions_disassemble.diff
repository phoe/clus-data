 Arguments and Values

  fn - an extended function designator or a lambda expression.
 Description

 The function disassemble is a debugging aid that composes symbolic instructions or expressions in some implementation-dependent language which represent the code used to produce the function which is or is named by the argument fn. The result is displayed to standard output in an implementation-dependent format.
 If fn is a lambda expression or interpreted function, it is compiled first and the result is disassembled.
-If the fn designator is a function name, the function that it names is disassembled.  (If that function is an interpreted function, it is first compiled but the result of this implicit compilation is not installed.)
+If the fn designator is a function name, the function that it names is disassembled.
+(If that function is an interpreted function, it is first compiled but the result of this implicit compilation is not installed.)
