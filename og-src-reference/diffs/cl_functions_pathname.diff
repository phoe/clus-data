+Syntax
+ pathname pathspec â†’ pathname
+Arguments and Values
+ pathspec - a pathname designator.
+ pathname - a pathname.
+Description
+Returns the pathname denoted by pathspec.
+If the pathspec designator is a stream, the stream can be either open or closed; in both cases, the pathname returned corresponds to the filename used to open the file. pathname returns the same pathname for a file stream after it is closed as it did when it was open.
+If the pathspec designator is a file stream created by opening a logical pathname, a logical pathname is returned.
+Examples
+There is a great degree of variability permitted here. The next several examples are intended to illustrate just a few of the many possibilities. Whether the name is canonicalized to a particular case (either upper or lower) depends on both the file system and the implementation since two different implementations using the same file system might differ on many
