 Arguments and Values

 class - a class.
 initargs - a list of keyword/value pairs (initialization argument names and values).
 new-instance - an object whose class is class.
 Description

 The generic function allocate-instance creates and returns a new instance of the class, without initializing it. When the class is a standard class, this means that the slots are unbound; when the class is a structure class, this means the slots' values are unspecified.
 The caller of allocate-instance is expected to have already checked the initialization arguments.
-The generic function allocate-instance is called by make-instance, as described in Section 7.1 (Object Creation and Initialization).
-Affected By None.
- Exceptional Situations None.
