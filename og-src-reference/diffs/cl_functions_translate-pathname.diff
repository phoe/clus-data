 Arguments and Values

 source - a pathname designator.
 from-wildcard - a pathname designator.
 to-wildcard - a pathname designator.
 translated-pathname - a pathname.
 Description

 translate-pathname translates source (that matches from-wildcard) into a corresponding pathname that matches to-wildcard, and returns the corresponding pathname.
-The resulting pathname is to-wildcard with each wildcard or missing field replaced by a portion of source. A ``wildcard field'' is a pathname component with a value of wild, a wild element of a list-valued directory component, or an implementation-defined portion of a component, such as the "*" in the complex wildcard string "foo*bar" that some implementations support. An implementation that adds other wildcard features, such as regular expressions, must define how translate-pathname extends to those features. A ``missing field'' is a pathname component with a value of nil.
+The resulting pathname is to-wildcard with each wildcard or missing field replaced by a portion of source. A "wildcard field" is a pathname component with a value of wild, a wild element of a list-valued directory component, or an implementation-defined portion of a component, such as the "*" in the complex wildcard string "foo*bar" that some implementations support. An implementation that adds other wildcard features, such as regular expressions, must define how translate-pathname extends to those features. A "missing field" is a pathname component with a value of nil.
  The portion of source that is copied into the resulting pathname is implementation-defined. Typically it is determined by the user interface conventions of the file systems involved. Usually it is the portion of source that matches a wildcard field of from-wildcard that is in the same position as the wildcard or missing field of to-wildcard. If there is no wildcard field in from-wildcard at that position, then usually it is the entire corresponding pathname component of source, or in the case of a list-valued directory component, the entire corresponding list element.
  During the copying of a portion of source into the resulting pathname, additional implementation-defined translations of case or file naming conventions might occur, especially when from-wildcard and to-wildcard are for different hosts.
 It is valid for source to be a wild pathname; in general this will produce a wild result. It is valid for from-wildcard and/or to-wildcard to be non-wild pathnames.
  There are no specified keyword arguments for translate-pathname, but implementations are permitted to extend it by adding keyword arguments.
   translate-pathname maps customary case in source into customary case in the output pathname.

 Exceptional Situations

 If any of source, from-wildcard, or to-wildcard is not a pathname, a string, or a stream associated with a file an error of type type-error is signaled.
 (pathname-match-p source from-wildcard) must be true or an error of type error is signaled.

 Notes

 The exact behavior of translate-pathname cannot be dictated by the Common Lisp language and must be allowed to vary, depending on the user interface conventions of the file systems involved.
 The following is an implementation guideline. One file system performs this operation by examining each piece of the three pathnames in turn, where a piece is a pathname component or a list element of a structured component such as a hierarchical directory. Hierarchical directory elements in from-wildcard and to-wildcard are matched by whether they are wildcards, not by depth in the directory hierarchy. If the piece in to-wildcard is present and not wild, it is copied into the result. If the piece in to-wildcard is wild or nil, the piece in source is copied into the result. Otherwise, the piece in to-wildcard might be a complex wildcard such as "foo*bar" and the piece in from-wildcard should be wild; the portion of the piece in source that matches the wildcard portion of the piece in from-wildcard replaces the wildcard portion of the piece in to-wildcard and the value produced is used in the result.
