 Type BOOLEAN
 Supertypes

 boolean, symbol, t
 Description

 The type boolean contains the symbols t and nil, which represent true and false, respectively.
 See Also

-t (constant variable), nil (constant variable), if, not, complement
+ Constant Variable T
+ Constant Variable NIL
+ Special Operator IF
+ Function NOT
+ Function COMPLEMENT
 Notes

 Conditional operations, such as if, permit the use of generalized booleans, not just booleans; any non-nil value, not just t, counts as true for a generalized boolean. However, as a matter of convention, the symbol t is considered the canonical value to use even for a generalized boolean when no better choice presents itself.
