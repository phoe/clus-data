 System Class REAL

 Class Precedence List
  real, number, t
 Description

-The type real includes all numbers that represent mathematical real numbers, though there are mathematical real numbers (e.g., irrational numbers) that do not have an exact representation in Common Lisp. Only reals can be ordered using the <, >, <=, and >= functions.
- The types rational and float are disjoint subtypes of type real.
