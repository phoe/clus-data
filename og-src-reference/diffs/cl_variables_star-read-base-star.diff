 Variable *READ-BASE*
 Value Type

 a radix.
 Initial Value

 10.
 Description

 Controls the interpretation of tokens by read as being integers or ratios.
-The value of *read-base*, called the current input base, is the radix in which integers and ratios are to be read by the Lisp reader. The parsing of other numeric types (e.g., floats) is not affected by this option.

### CLHS "e.g.," CLUS "e.g."
 The effect of *read-base* on the reading of any particular rational number can be locally overridden by explicit use of the #O, #X, #B, or #nR syntax or by a trailing decimal point.
