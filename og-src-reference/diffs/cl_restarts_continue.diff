+Description
+The continue restart is generally part of protocols where there is a single "obvious" way to continue, such as in break and cerror. Some user-defined protocols may also wish to incorporate it for similar reasons. In general, however, it is more reliable to design a special purpose restart with a name that more directly suits the particular application.
+Examples
+(let ((x 3))
+  (handler-bind ((error #'(lambda (c)
+                            (let ((r (find-restart 'continue c)))
+                              (when r (invoke-restart r))))))
+    (cond ((not (floatp x))
+           (cerror "Try floating it." "~D is not a float." x) (float x))
+          (t x))))
