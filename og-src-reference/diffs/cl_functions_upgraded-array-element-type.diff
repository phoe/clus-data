 Arguments and Values

 typespec - a type specifier.
 environment - an environment object. The default is nil, denoting the null lexical environment and the current global environment.
 upgraded-typespec - a type specifier.
 Description

 Returns the element type of the most specialized array representation capable of holding items of the type denoted by typespec.
 The typespec is a subtype of (and possibly type equivalent to) the upgraded-typespec.
-If typespec is bit, the result is type equivalent to bit.  If typespec is base-char, the result is type equivalent to base-char.  If typespec is character, the result is type equivalent to character.
+If typespec is bit, the result is type equivalent to bit.
+If typespec is base-char, the result is type equivalent to base-char.
+If typespec is character, the result is type equivalent to character.
 The purpose of upgraded-array-element-type is to reveal how an implementation does its upgrading.
 The environment is used to expand any derived type specifiers that are mentioned in the typespec.
