 Description
  
-For the four defined subtypes of type float, it is true that intermediate between the type short-float and the type long-float are the type single-float and the type double-float. The precise definition of these categories is implementation-defined. The precision (measured in ``bits'', computed as p log 2b) and the exponent size (also measured in ``bits,'' computed as  log 2(n+1), where n is the maximum exponent value) is recommended to be at least as great as the values in the next figure. Each of the defined subtypes of type float might or might not have a minus zero.
