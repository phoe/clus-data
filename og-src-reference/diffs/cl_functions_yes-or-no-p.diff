 Description

 These functions ask a question and parse a response from the user. They return true if the answer is affirmative, or false if the answer is negative.
-y-or-n-p is for asking the user a question whose answer is either ``yes'' or ``no.'' It is intended that the reply require the user to answer a yes-or-no question with a single character. yes-or-no-p is also for asking the user a question whose answer is either ``Yes'' or ``No.'' It is intended that the reply require the user to take more action than just a single keystroke, such as typing the full word yes or no followed by a newline.

 y-or-n-p types out a message (if supplied), reads an answer in some implementation-dependent manner (intended to be short and simple, such as reading a single character such as Y or N). yes-or-no-p types out a message (if supplied), attracts the user's attention (for example, by ringing the terminal's bell), and reads an answer in some implementation-dependent manner (intended to be multiple characters, such as YES or NO).
-If format-control is supplied and not nil, then a fresh-line operation is performed; then a message is printed as if format-control and arguments were given to format. In any case, yes-or-no-p and y-or-n-p will provide a prompt such as ``(Y or N)'' or ``(Yes or No)'' if appropriate.
