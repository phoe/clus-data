 Arguments and Values

 number - a number.
 phase - a number.
 Description

-phase returns the phase of number (the angle part of its polar representation) in radians, in the range  -<PI> (exclusive) if minus zero is not supported, or -<PI> (inclusive) if minus zero is supported,  to <PI> (inclusive). The phase of a positive  real  number is zero; that of a negative  real  number is <PI>. The phase of zero is defined to be zero.
+phase returns the phase of number (the angle part of its polar representation) in radians, in the range -π (exclusive) if minus zero is not supported, or -π (inclusive) if minus zero is supported, to π (inclusive). The phase of a positive real number is zero; that of a negative real number is π. The phase of zero is defined to be zero.
 If number is a complex float, the result is a float of the same type as the components of number. If number is a float, the result is a float of the same type. If number is a rational or a complex rational, the result is a single float.
-The branch cut for phase lies along the negative real axis, continuous with quadrant II. The range consists of that portion of the real axis between -<PI> (exclusive) and <PI> (inclusive).
+The branch cut for phase lies along the negative real axis, continuous with quadrant II. The range consists of that portion of the real axis between -π (exclusive) and~π (inclusive).
### CLUS "and~π"
  The mathematical definition of phase is as follows
 (phase x) = (atan (imagpart x) (realpart x))
