 Arguments and Values

  pathspec - a pathname designator, which may contain wild components.
 pathnames - a list of  physical pathnames.
 Description

 Determines which, if any, files that are present in the file system have names matching pathspec, and returns a  fresh  list of pathnames corresponding to the truenames of those files.
 An implementation may be extended to accept implementation-defined keyword arguments to directory.
-Examples None.

 Notes

 If the pathspec is not wild, the resulting list will contain either zero or one elements.
-Common Lisp specifies ``&key'' in the argument list to directory even though no standardized keyword arguments to directory are defined. ``allow-other-keys t'' may be used in conforming programs in order to quietly ignore any additional keywords which are passed by the program but not supported by the implementation.
