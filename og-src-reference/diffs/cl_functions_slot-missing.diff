 slot-missing (class t) object slot-name operation &optional new-value

 Arguments and Values

 class - the class of object.
 object - an object.
 slot-name - a symbol (the name of a would-be slot).
 operation - one of the symbols setf, slot-boundp, slot-makunbound, or slot-value.
 new-value - an object.
 result - an object.
 Description

 The generic function slot-missing is invoked when an attempt is made to access a slot in an object whose metaclass is standard-class and the slot of the name slot-name is not a name of a slot in that class. The default method signals an error.
 The generic function slot-missing is not intended to be called by programmers. Programmers may write methods for it.
 The generic function slot-missing may be called during evaluation of slot-value, (setf slot-value), slot-boundp, and slot-makunbound. For each of these operations the corresponding symbol for the operation argument is slot-value, setf, slot-boundp, and slot-makunbound respectively.
 The optional new-value argument to slot-missing is used when the operation is attempting to set the value of the slot.
  If slot-missing returns, its values will be treated as follows
   If the operation is setf or slot-makunbound, any values will be ignored by the caller.
   If the operation is slot-value, only the primary value will be used by the caller, and all other values will be ignored.
   If the operation is slot-boundp, any boolean equivalent of the primary value of the method might be is used, and all other values will be ignored.
