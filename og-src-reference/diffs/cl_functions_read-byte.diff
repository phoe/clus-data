 Arguments and Values

 stream - a binary input stream.
 eof-error-p - a generalized boolean. The default is true.
  eof-value - an object. The default is nil.
 byte - an integer, or the eof-value.
 Description

 read-byte reads and returns one byte from stream.
-If an end of file[2] occurs and eof-error-p is false, the eof-value is returned.
+If an end of file occurs and eof-error-p is false, the eof-value is returned.

 Exceptional Situations

 Should signal an error of type type-error if stream is not a stream.
 Should signal an error of type error if stream is not a binary input stream.
 If there are no bytes remaining in the stream and eof-error-p is true, an error of type end-of-file is signaled.
