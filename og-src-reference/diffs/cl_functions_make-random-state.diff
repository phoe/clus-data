 Arguments and Values

 state - a random state, or nil, or t. The default is nil.
 new-state - a random state object.
 Description

-Creates a fresh object of type random-state suitable for use as the value of *random-state*.
### CLHS "*random-state*" CLUS "Variable *RANDOM-STATE*"
-If state is a random state object, the new-state is a copy[5] of that object. If state is nil, the new-state is a copy[5] of the current random state. If state is t, the new-state is a fresh random state object that has been randomly initialized by some means.

 Notes

 One important use of make-random-state is to allow the same series of pseudo-random numbers to be generated many times within a single program.
