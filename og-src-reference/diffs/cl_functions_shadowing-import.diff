### Line changed
 Description

 shadowing-import is like import, but it does not signal an error even if the importation of a symbol would shadow some symbol already accessible in package.
 shadowing-import inserts each of symbols into package as an internal symbol, regardless of whether another symbol of the same name is shadowed by this action. If a different symbol of the same name is already present in package, that symbol is first uninterned from package. The new symbol is added to package's shadowing-symbols list.
 shadowing-import does name-conflict checking to the extent that it checks whether a distinct existing symbol with the same name is accessible; if so, it is shadowed by the new symbol, which implies that it must be uninterned if it was present in package.
