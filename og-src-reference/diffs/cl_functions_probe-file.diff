 Arguments and Values

  pathspec - a pathname designator.
  truename - a physical pathname or nil.
 Description

 probe-file tests whether a file exists.
 probe-file returns false if there is no file named pathspec, and otherwise returns the truename of pathspec.
-If the pathspec designator is an open stream, then probe-file produces the truename of its associated file.  If pathspec is a stream, whether open or closed, it is coerced to a pathname as if by the function pathname.
-Examples None.
