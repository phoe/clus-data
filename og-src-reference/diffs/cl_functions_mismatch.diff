 Arguments and Values

 Sequence-1 - a sequence.
 Sequence-2 - a sequence.
 from-end - a generalized boolean. The default is false.
 test - a designator for a function of two arguments that returns a generalized boolean.
 test-not - a designator for a function of two arguments that returns a generalized boolean.
+ key - a designator for a function of one argument, or nil.
   start1, end1 - bounding index designators of sequence-1. The defaults for start1 and end1 are 0 and nil, respectively.
 start2, end2 - bounding index designators of sequence-2. The defaults for start2 and end2 are 0 and nil, respectively.
-key - a designator for a function of one argument, or nil.
### Text rearranged
-position - a bounding index of sequence-1, or nil.
+ position - a bounding index of sequence-2, or nil.
### CLHS "sequence-1" CLUS "sequence-2"
 Description

 The specified subsequences of sequence-1 and sequence-2 are compared element-wise.
 The key argument is used for both the sequence-1 and the sequence-2.
 If sequence-1 and sequence-2 are of equal length and match in every element, the result is false. Otherwise, the result is a non-negative integer, the index within sequence-1 of the leftmost or rightmost position, depending on from-end, at which the two subsequences fail to match. If one subsequence is shorter than and a matching prefix of the other, the result is the index relative to sequence-1 beyond the last position tested.
 If from-end is true, then one plus the index of the rightmost position in which the sequences differ is returned. In effect, the subsequences are aligned at their right-hand ends; then, the last elements are compared, the penultimate elements, and so on. The index returned is an index relative to sequence-1.
