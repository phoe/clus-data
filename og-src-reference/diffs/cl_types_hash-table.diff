 Notes

-The intent is that this mapping be implemented by a hashing mechanism, such as that described in Section 6.4 ``Hashing'' of  The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3 (pp506-549). In spite of this intent, no conforming implementation is required to use any particular technique to implement the mapping.
