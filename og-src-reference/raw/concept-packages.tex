\beginsubSection{Introduction to Packages}

A //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// establishes a mapping from names to //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]//.  At any given time, one //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// is current. The //[[CL:Glossary:current package]]// is the one that is \thevalueof{*package*}. When using the //[[CL:Glossary:Lisp reader]]//, it is possible to refer to //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]// in //[[CL:Glossary:packages]]//  other than the current one through the use of //[[CL:Glossary:package prefixes]]// in the  printed representation of the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//.

\Thenextfigure\ lists some //[[CL:Glossary:defined names]]// that are applicable to //[[CL:Glossary:packages]]//.

Where an //[[CL:Glossary:operator]]//  takes an argument that is either a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// or a //[[CL:Glossary:list]]//  of //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]//, an argument of \nil\ is treated as an empty //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// of //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]//. Any //package// argument may be either a //[[CL:Glossary:string]]//, a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//, or a //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//.  If a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is supplied, its name will be used as the //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// name. \issue{REQUIRE-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS:ELIMINATE}

\beginsubsubsection{Package Names and Nicknames}

Each //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// has a //[[CL:Glossary:name]]// (a //[[CL:Glossary:string]]//) and perhaps some //[[CL:Glossary:nicknames]]// (also //[[CL:Glossary:strings]]//). These are assigned when the //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// is created and can be changed later.  

There is a single namespace for //[[CL:Glossary:packages]]//.   \Thefunction{find-package} translates a package //[[CL:Glossary:name]]// or //[[CL:Glossary:nickname]]// into the associated //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//.   \Thefunction{package-name} returns the //[[CL:Glossary:name]]// of a //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//.   \Thefunction{package-nicknames} returns  a //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// of all //[[CL:Glossary:nicknames]]// for a //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//. **[[CL:Functions:rename-package]]** removes a //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//'s current //[[CL:Glossary:name]]// and //[[CL:Glossary:nicknames]]// and replaces them with new ones specified by the caller.

\endsubsubsection%{Package Names and Nicknames}

\beginsubsubsection{Symbols in a Package}

\beginsubsubsubsection{Internal and External Symbols}

The mappings in a //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// are divided into two classes, external and internal. The //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]// targeted by these different mappings  are called //[[CL:Glossary:external symbols]]// and //[[CL:Glossary:internal symbols]]//\idxterm{internal symbol} of the //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//. Within a //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//, a name refers to one //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// or to none; if it does refer to a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//, then it is either external or internal in that //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//, but not both.

\newtermidx{External symbols}{external symbol} are part of the package's public interface to other //[[CL:Glossary:packages]]//. //[[CL:Glossary:Symbols]]// become //[[CL:Glossary:external symbols]]// of a given //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// if they have been //[[CL:Glossary:exported]]// from that //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//.

A //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// has the same //[[CL:Glossary:name]]// no matter what //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//  it is //[[CL:Glossary:present]]// in, but it might be an //[[CL:Glossary:external symbol]]// of some //[[CL:Glossary:packages]]// and an //[[CL:Glossary:internal symbol]]// of others. 

\endsubsubsubsection%{Internal and External Symbols}

\beginsubsubsubsection{Package Inheritance}

//[[CL:Glossary:Packages]]// can be built up in layers.  From one point of view, a //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// is a single collection of mappings from //[[CL:Glossary:strings]]// into //[[CL:Glossary:internal symbols]]// and  //[[CL:Glossary:external symbols]]//. However, some of these mappings might be established within the //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//  itself, while other mappings are inherited from other //[[CL:Glossary:packages]]//  via **[[CL:Functions:use-package]]**. A //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is said to be //[[CL:Glossary:present]]// in a //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//  if the mapping is in the //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// itself and is not inherited from somewhere else.

There is no way to inherit the //[[CL:Glossary:internal symbols]]// of another //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//; to refer to an //[[CL:Glossary:internal symbol]]// using the //[[CL:Glossary:Lisp reader]]//, 
    a //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// containing the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// 
     must be made to be the //[[CL:Glossary:current package]]//,
    a //[[CL:Glossary:package prefix]]// must be used,
 or the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// must be //[[CL:Glossary:imported]]// into the //[[CL:Glossary:current package]]//.

\endsubsubsubsection%{Package Inheritance}

\beginsubsubsubsection{Accessibility of Symbols in a Package}

A //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// becomes //[[CL:Glossary:accessible]]// in a //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// 
    if that is its //[[CL:Glossary:home package]]// when it is created,
 or if it is //[[CL:Glossary:imported]]// into that //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//,
 or by inheritance via **[[CL:Functions:use-package]]**.

If a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is //[[CL:Glossary:accessible]]// in a //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//, it can be referred to when using the //[[CL:Glossary:Lisp reader]]// without a //[[CL:Glossary:package prefix]]// when that //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// is the //[[CL:Glossary:current package]]//, regardless of whether it is //[[CL:Glossary:present]]// or inherited.

//[[CL:Glossary:Symbols]]// from one //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// can be made //[[CL:Glossary:accessible]]//  in another //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// in two ways.

\beginlist  \itemitem{--} Any individual //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// can be added to a //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// by use of **[[CL:Functions:import]]**.  After the call to **[[CL:Functions:import]]** the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is //[[CL:Glossary:present]]// in the importing //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//. The status of the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// in the //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//  it came from (if any) is unchanged, and the //[[CL:Glossary:home package]]// for this //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is unchanged. Once //[[CL:Glossary:imported]]//, a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is //[[CL:Glossary:present]]// in the importing //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// and can be removed only by calling **[[CL:Functions:unintern]]**.

A //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is //[[CL:Glossary:shadowed]]//\meaning{3} by another //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//  in some //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// if the first //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// would be //[[CL:Glossary:accessible]]// by inheritance if not for the presence of the second //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//. See **[[CL:Functions:shadowing-import]]**.

\itemitem{--} The second mechanism for making //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]// from one //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// //[[CL:Glossary:accessible]]// in another is provided by **[[CL:Functions:use-package]]**.   All of the //[[CL:Glossary:external symbols]]// of the used //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// are inherited by the using //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//. \Thefunction{unuse-package} undoes the effects of a previous **[[CL:Functions:use-package]]**.   \endlist

\endsubsubsubsection%{Accessibility of Symbols in a Package}

\beginsubsubsubsection{Locating a Symbol in a Package}

When a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is to be located in a given //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//  the following occurs: \beginlist  \itemitem{--} The //[[CL:Glossary:external symbols]]// and //[[CL:Glossary:internal symbols]]// of the  //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// are searched for the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//. \itemitem{--} The //[[CL:Glossary:external symbols]]// of the used //[[CL:Glossary:packages]]// are  searched in some unspecified order.  The order does not matter; see the rules for handling name conflicts listed below.  \endlist

\endsubsubsubsection%{Locating a Symbol in a Package}

\beginsubsubsubsection{Prevention of Name Conflicts in Packages}

Within one //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//, any particular name can refer to at most one //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//.  A name conflict is said to occur when there would be more than one candidate //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//.  Any time a name conflict is about to occur, a //[[CL:Glossary:correctable]]// //[[CL:Glossary:error]]// is signaled.  

The following rules apply to name conflicts:

\beginlist

\itemitem{--} Name conflicts are detected when they become possible, that is, when the package structure is altered.  Name conflicts are not checked during every name lookup.

\itemitem{--} If the //[[CL:Glossary:same]]// //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// is //[[CL:Glossary:accessible]]// to a //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//  through more than one path, there is no name conflict. A //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// cannot conflict with itself.  Name conflicts occur only between //[[CL:Glossary:distinct]]// //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]// with the same name (under **[[CL:Functions:string=]]**).

\itemitem{--} Every //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// has a list of shadowing //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]//.   A shadowing //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// takes precedence over any other //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// of the same name that would otherwise be //[[CL:Glossary:accessible]]// in the //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//.   A name conflict involving a shadowing symbol is always resolved in favor of the shadowing //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//, without signaling an error (except for one exception involving **[[CL:Functions:import]]**). See **[[CL:Functions:shadow]]** and **[[CL:Functions:shadowing-import]]**.

\itemitem{--}  The functions **[[CL:Functions:use-package]]**, **[[CL:Functions:import]]**, and  **[[CL:Functions:export]]** check for name conflicts.  

\itemitem{--}  **[[CL:Functions:shadow]]** and **[[CL:Functions:shadowing-import]]**  never signal a name-conflict error.

\itemitem{--} 

**[[CL:Functions:unuse-package]]** and **[[CL:Functions:unexport]]** do not need to do any name-conflict checking. **[[CL:Functions:unintern]]** does name-conflict checking only when a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//  being //[[CL:Glossary:uninterned]]// is a //[[CL:Glossary:shadowing symbol]]//\idxterm{shadowing symbol}.

\itemitem{--}  Giving a shadowing symbol to **[[CL:Functions:unintern]]**  can uncover a name conflict that had previously been resolved by the shadowing.  

  \itemitem{--} 
  Package functions signal name-conflict errors \oftype{package-error} before making any
  change to the package structure.  When multiple changes are to be made,
  it is
  permissible for the implementation to process each change separately.
  For example, when **[[CL:Functions:export]]** is given a  //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// of  //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]//,
  aborting from a name
  conflict caused by the second //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// 
  in the //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// might still export the
  first //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// in the //[[CL:Glossary:list]]//.  
  However, a name-conflict error caused by **[[CL:Functions:export]]**
  of a single //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// will be signaled before
  that //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//'s //[[CL:Glossary:accessibility]]// in any //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// is changed.

\itemitem{--}  Continuing from a name-conflict error must offer the user a chance to resolve the name conflict in favor of either of the candidates.  The //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//  structure should be altered to reflect the resolution of the name conflict, via **[[CL:Functions:shadowing-import]]**,  **[[CL:Functions:unintern]]**,

or **[[CL:Functions:unexport]]**.

\itemitem{--}  A name conflict in **[[CL:Functions:use-package]]** between a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// 

//[[CL:Glossary:present]]// in the using //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// and an //[[CL:Glossary:external symbol]]// of the used  //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// is resolved in favor of the first //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// by making it a shadowing //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//, or in favor of the second //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// by uninterning the first //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// from the using //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//. 

\itemitem{--}  A name conflict in **[[CL:Functions:export]]** or **[[CL:Functions:unintern]]**  due to a //[[CL:Glossary:package]]//'s inheriting two //[[CL:Glossary:distinct]]// //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]//  with the //[[CL:Glossary:same]]// //[[CL:Glossary:name]]// (under **[[CL:Functions:string=]]**) from two other //[[CL:Glossary:packages]]// can be resolved in favor of either //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// by importing it into the using //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// and making it a //[[CL:Glossary:shadowing symbol]]//\idxterm{shadowing symbol}, just as with **[[CL:Functions:use-package]]**. \endlist

\beginsubsubsection{The COMMON-LISP Package}  \idxpackref{common-lisp}\idxpackref{cl}

\issue{LISP-PACKAGE-NAME:COMMON-LISP}
  \Thepackage{common-lisp} contains the primitives of the \clisp\ system as defined by this specification.  Its //[[CL:Glossary:external]]// //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]// include all of the //[[CL:Glossary:defined names]]// (except for //[[CL:Glossary:defined names]]// in \thepackage{keyword}) that are present in the \clisp\ system,  such as **[[CL:Functions:car]]**, **[[CL:Functions:cdr]]**,  \varref{*package*}, etc. \Thepackage{common-lisp} has the //[[CL:Glossary:nickname]]// \packref{cl}.
  \issue{PACKAGE-CLUTTER:REDUCE} \Thepackage{common-lisp} has as //[[CL:Glossary:external]]// //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]// those  symbols enumerated in the figures in \secref\CLsymbols, and no others. These //[[CL:Glossary:external]]// //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]// are //[[CL:Glossary:present]]// in \thepackage{common-lisp} but their //[[CL:Glossary:home package]]// need not be \thepackage{common-lisp}.

For example, the symbol \f{HELP} cannot be an //[[CL:Glossary:external symbol]]// of \thepackage{common-lisp} because it is not mentioned in \secref\CLsymbols. In contrast, the //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// \misc{variable} must be an //[[CL:Glossary:external symbol]]// of \thepackage{common-lisp}  even though it has no definition because it is listed in that section (to support its use as a valid second //[[CL:Glossary:argument]]// to \thefunction{documentation}). 

\Thepackage{common-lisp} can have additional //[[CL:Glossary:internal symbols]]//.

\beginsubsubsubsection{Constraints on the COMMON-LISP Package for Conforming Implementations}

\issue{PACKAGE-CLUTTER:REDUCE} In a //[[CL:Glossary:conforming implementation]]//, an //[[CL:Glossary:external]]// //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// of \thepackage{common-lisp} can have
   a //[[CL:Glossary:function]]//, //[[CL:Glossary:macro]]//, or //[[CL:Glossary:special operator]]// definition, 

   a //[[CL:Glossary:global variable]]// definition
   (or other status as a //[[CL:Glossary:dynamic variable]]// 
    due to a **[[CL:Declarations:special]]** //[[CL:Glossary:proclamation]]//), or a //[[CL:Glossary:type]]// definition only if explicitly permitted in this standard.

For example,
  **[[CL:Functions:fboundp]]** //[[CL:Glossary:yields]]// //[[CL:Glossary:false]]// 
  for any //[[CL:Glossary:external symbol]]// of \thepackage{common-lisp} 
  that is not the //[[CL:Glossary:name]]// of a //[[CL:Glossary:standardized]]// 
   //[[CL:Glossary:function]]//, //[[CL:Glossary:macro]]// or //[[CL:Glossary:special operator]]//, and
  **[[CL:Functions:boundp]]** returns //[[CL:Glossary:false]]// 
  for any //[[CL:Glossary:external symbol]]// of \thepackage{common-lisp} 
  that is not the //[[CL:Glossary:name]]// of a //[[CL:Glossary:standardized]]// //[[CL:Glossary:global variable]]//. It also follows that
  //[[CL:Glossary:conforming programs]]// can use //[[CL:Glossary:external symbols]]// of \thepackage{common-lisp} 
  as the //[[CL:Glossary:names]]// of local //[[CL:Glossary:lexical variables]]// 
  with confidence that those //[[CL:Glossary:names]]// have not been //[[CL:Glossary:proclaimed]]// **[[CL:Declarations:special]]** 
  by the //[[CL:Glossary:implementation]]//
  unless those //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]// are
    //[[CL:Glossary:names]]// of //[[CL:Glossary:standardized]]// //[[CL:Glossary:global variables]]//.

A //[[CL:Glossary:conforming implementation]]// must not place any //[[CL:Glossary:property]]// on an //[[CL:Glossary:external symbol]]// of \thepackage{common-lisp} using a //[[CL:Glossary:property indicator]]// that is either an //[[CL:Glossary:external symbol]]// of any //[[CL:Glossary:standardized]]// //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// or a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// that is otherwise //[[CL:Glossary:accessible]]// in \thepackage{common-lisp-user}.

\Thepackage{keyword} contains //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]//, called //[[CL:Glossary:keywords]]//\meaning{1}, that are typically used as special markers in //[[CL:Glossary:programs]]//  and their associated data //[[CL:Glossary:expressions]]//\meaning{1}.

\beginsubsubsubsection{Notes about The KEYWORD Package}

It is generally best to confine the use of //[[CL:Glossary:keywords]]// to situations in which there are a finitely enumerable set of names to be selected between.  For example, if there were two states of a light switch, they might be called **'':on''** and **'':off''**.

In situations where the set of names is not finitely enumerable (\ie where name conflicts might arise) it is frequently best to use //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]// in some //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// other than \packref{keyword} so that conflicts will be naturally avoided. For example, it is generally not wise for a //[[CL:Glossary:program]]// to use a //[[CL:Glossary:keyword]]//\meaning{1}  as a //[[CL:Glossary:property indicator]]//, since if there were ever another //[[CL:Glossary:program]]// that did the same thing, each would clobber the other's data.

It is recommended, but not required, that the documentation for a //[[CL:Glossary:conforming implementation]]// contain a full list of all //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// names initially present in that //[[CL:Glossary:implementation]]// but not specified in this specification. (See also the //[[CL:Glossary:function]]// **[[CL:Functions:list-all-packages]]**.)
