  The consequences are undefined 

when //[[CL:Glossary:code]]// executed during an //[[CL:Glossary:object-traversing]]// operation

destructively modifies the //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// in a way that might affect the ongoing traversal operation. In particular, the following rules apply. \beginlist \itemitem{\b{List traversal}}
 
 For //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// traversal operations, the //[[CL:Glossary:cdr]]// chain of the
 //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// is not allowed to be destructively modified.
  \itemitem{\b{Array traversal}}

  For //[[CL:Glossary:array]]// traversal operations, the //[[CL:Glossary:array]]// is not allowed 
  to be adjusted and its //[[CL:Glossary:fill pointer]]//, if any, is not allowed to 
  be changed.
  \itemitem{\b{Hash-table traversal}}

  For //[[CL:Glossary:hash table]]// traversal operations, new elements may not be added
  or deleted except that the element corresponding to the current hash key 
  may be changed or removed.
  \itemitem{\b{Package traversal}}

  For //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// traversal operations (\eg \macref{do-symbols}),
  new //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]// may not be //[[CL:Glossary:interned]]// in or //[[CL:Glossary:uninterned]]// 
  from the //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// being traversed 
  or any //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// that it uses except that the 
  current //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// may be //[[CL:Glossary:uninterned]]// from the //[[CL:Glossary:package]]// 
  being traversed.
