A //[[CL:Glossary:cons]]// is a compound data //[[CL:Glossary:object]]//  having two components called the //[[CL:Glossary:car]]// and the //[[CL:Glossary:cdr]]//.

Depending on context, a group of connected //[[CL:Glossary:conses]]// can be viewed in a variety of different ways.  A variety of operations is provided to support each of these various views.

\beginsubsection{Conses as Trees}

A //[[CL:Glossary:tree]]// is a binary recursive data structure made up of //[[CL:Glossary:conses]]// and //[[CL:Glossary:atoms]]//: the //[[CL:Glossary:conses]]// are themselves also //[[CL:Glossary:trees]]// (sometimes called ``subtrees'' or ``branches''), and the //[[CL:Glossary:atoms]]// are terminal nodes (sometimes called //[[CL:Glossary:leaves]]//).  Typically, the //[[CL:Glossary:leaves]]// represent data while the branches  establish some relationship among that data.

\beginsubsection{Conses as Lists}

A //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// is a chain of //[[CL:Glossary:conses]]// in which the //[[CL:Glossary:car]]// of each //[[CL:Glossary:cons]]// is an //[[CL:Glossary:element]]// of the //[[CL:Glossary:list]]//,  and the //[[CL:Glossary:cdr]]// of each //[[CL:Glossary:cons]]// is either the next link in the chain or a terminating //[[CL:Glossary:atom]]//.  

A //[[CL:Glossary:proper list]]// is a //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// terminated by the //[[CL:Glossary:empty list]]//. The //[[CL:Glossary:empty list]]// is a //[[CL:Glossary:proper list]]//, but is not a //[[CL:Glossary:cons]]//.

An //[[CL:Glossary:improper list]]// is a //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// that is not a //[[CL:Glossary:proper list]]//; that is, it is a //[[CL:Glossary:circular list]]// or a //[[CL:Glossary:dotted list]]//.

A //[[CL:Glossary:dotted list]]// is a //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// that has a terminating //[[CL:Glossary:atom]]// that is not the //[[CL:Glossary:empty list]]//.  A //[[CL:Glossary:non-nil]]// //[[CL:Glossary:atom]]// by itself is not considered to be a //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// of any kind---not even a //[[CL:Glossary:dotted list]]//.

A //[[CL:Glossary:circular list]]// is a chain of //[[CL:Glossary:conses]]// that has no termination  because some //[[CL:Glossary:cons]]// in the chain is the //[[CL:Glossary:cdr]]// of a later //[[CL:Glossary:cons]]//.

An //[[CL:Glossary:association list]]// is a //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// of //[[CL:Glossary:conses]]//  representing an association of //[[CL:Glossary:keys]]// with //[[CL:Glossary:values]]//,  where the //[[CL:Glossary:car]]// of each //[[CL:Glossary:cons]]// is the //[[CL:Glossary:key]]//  and the //[[CL:Glossary:cdr]]// is the //[[CL:Glossary:value]]// associated with that //[[CL:Glossary:key]]//.
