\issue{SUBSETTING-POSITION:NONE} The language described in this standard contains no subsets, though subsets are not forbidden.

For a language to be considered a subset, it must have the property that any valid //[[CL:Glossary:program]]// in that language has equivalent semantics and will run directly (with no extralingual pre-processing, and no special compatibility packages) in any //[[CL:Glossary:conforming implementation]]// of the full language.

A language that conforms to this requirement shall be described as being a ``subset of \clisp\ as specified by ANSI \metavar{standard number}.''
