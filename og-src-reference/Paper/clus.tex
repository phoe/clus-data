\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The \cl{} programming language has many bodies of documentation---the language specification \cite{ANSI:1994:standard} itself, language extensions, and multiple libraries. I outline issues with the current state of \cl{} documentation and propose an improvement in form of the \cl{} \us{}. It is a project of modernizing the \LaTeX sources of the draft standard \cite{ANSI:1994:draft} of \cl{} and ultimately unifying it with other bodies of \cl{} documentation.

This is achieved through semi-automatic parsing and formatting of the sources using a text editor, regular expressions, and other text processing tools. The processed text is then displayed in a web browser by means of a wiki engine.

The project is currently in its late phase with the greater part of the specification parsed and edited. A demo of the project is available at \url{http://phoe.tymoon.eu/clus/}.
