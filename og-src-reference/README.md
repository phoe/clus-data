# clus-data
This is the data for the Common Lisp UltraSpec, currently deployed at http://phoe.tymoon.eu/clus/

There are two folders there, `live` and `raw`. `live` is exactly what is currently deployed on the website and `raw` is what I am working on right now, which is not ready to be pushed to the website just yet.

Don't mind the other folders - this will be cleaned up, eventually.

All data in this repository is in the public domain unless stated otherwise by an appropriate LICENSE file put in the directory the other license encloses.
