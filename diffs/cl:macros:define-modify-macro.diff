 Arguments and Values
  
 name - a symbol. 
 lambda-list - a define-modify-macro lambda list 
 function - a symbol. 
 documentation - a string; not evaluated. 
-Description
  
-define-modify-macro defines a macro named name to read and write a place. 
-The arguments to the new macro are a place, followed by the arguments that are supplied in lambda-list.  Macros defined with define-modify-macro correctly pass the environment parameter to  get-setf-expansion.   
-When the macro is invoked, function is applied to the old contents of the place and the lambda-list arguments to obtain the new value, and the place is updated to contain the result. 
-Except for the issue of avoiding multiple evaluation (see below), the expansion of a define-modify-macro is equivalent to the following 
 
- (defmacro name (reference . lambda-list)
-   documentation
-   `(setf ,reference
-          (function ,reference ,arg1 ,arg2 ...)))
 
-<TT> 
-where arg1, arg2, ..., are the parameters appearing in lambda-list; appropriate provision is made for a rest parameter. 
- The subforms of the macro calls defined by define-modify-macro are evaluated as specified in Section 5.1.1.1 (Evaluation of Subforms to Places).  
- Documentation is attached as a documentation string to name (as kind function) and to the macro function.  
- If a define-modify-macro form appears as a top level form, the compiler must store the macro definition at compile time, so that occurrences of the macro later on in the file can be expanded correctly.  
-Examples
+Description
+define-modify-macro defines a macro named name to read and write a place.
  
 
- (define-modify-macro appendf (&rest args) 
-    append "Append onto list") =>  APPENDF
- (setq x '(a b c) y x) =>  (A B C)
- (appendf x '(d e f) '(1 2 3)) =>  (A B C D E F 1 2 3)
- x =>  (A B C D E F 1 2 3)
- y =>  (A B C)
- (define-modify-macro new-incf (&optional (delta 1)) +)
- (define-modify-macro unionf (other-set &rest keywords) union)
+The arguments to the new macro are a place, followed by the arguments that are supplied in lambda-list.
