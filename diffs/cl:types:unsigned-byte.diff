 unsigned-byte [s | *]
  
 Compound Type Specifier Arguments
  
 s - a positive integer. 
 Compound Type Specifier Description
  
-This denotes the set of non-negative integers that can be represented in a byte of size s (bits). This is equivalent to (mod m) for m=2^s, or to (integer 0 n) for n=2^s-1. The type unsigned-byte or the type (unsigned-byte *) is the same as the type (integer 0 *), the set of non-negative integers. 
+This denotes the set of non-negative integers that can be represented in a byte of size s (bits). This is equivalent to (mod m) for m = 2s, or to (integer 0 n) for n = 2s - 1. The type unsigned-byte or the type (unsigned-byte *) is the same as the type (integer 0 *), the set of non-negative integers.
 Notes
  
 The type (unsigned-byte 1) is also called bit.
