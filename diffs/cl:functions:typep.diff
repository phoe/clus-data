 Arguments and Values
  
+
 object - an object. 
-type-specifier - any type specifier except values, or a type specifier list whose first element is either function or values. 
+
+ type-specifier - any type specifier, except values or a type specifier list starting with either function or values.
+
 environment - an environment object. The default is nil, denoting the null lexical environment and the and current global environment. 
+
 generalized-boolean - a generalized boolean. 
+
+

 Description
  
+
 Returns true if object is of the type specified by type-specifier; otherwise, returns false. 
+
+
 A type-specifier of the form (satisfies fn) is handled by applying the function fn to object. 
- (typep object '(array type-specifier)), where type-specifier is not *, returns true if and only if object is an array that could be the result of supplying type-specifier as the element-type argument to make-array. (array *) refers to all arrays regardless of element type, while (array type-specifier) refers only to those arrays that can result from giving type-specifier as the element-type argument to make-array. A similar interpretation applies to (simple-array type-specifier) and (vector type-specifier). See Section 15.1.2.1 (Array Upgrading). 
-(typep object '(complex type-specifier)) returns true for all complex numbers that can result from giving numbers of type type-specifier to the function complex, plus all other complex numbers of the same specialized representation. Both the real and the imaginary parts of any such complex number must satisfy

 Exceptional Situations
  
+
 An error of type error is signaled if type-specifier is values, or a type specifier list whose first element is either function or values. 
+
+
 The consequences are undefined if the type-specifier is not a type specifier.
