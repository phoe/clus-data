-Special Operator LET, LET* 
+This topic does not exist yet
  
-Syntax
  
- 
-let ({var | (var [init-form])}*) declaration* form* => result*
- 
-let* ({var | (var [init-form])}*) declaration* form* => result*
-  
-Arguments and Values
- 
-var - a symbol. 
-init-form - a form. 
-declaration - a declare expression; not evaluated. 
-form - a form. 
-results - the values returned by the forms. 
-Description
- 
-let and let* create new variable bindings and execute a series of forms that use these bindings. let performs the bindings in parallel and let* does them sequentially. 
-The form 
- 
- (let ((var1 init-form-1)
-       (var2 init-form-2)
-       ...
-       (varm init-form-m))
-   declaration1
-   declaration2
-   ...
-   declarationp
-   form1
-   form2
-   ...
-   formn)
-<TT> first evaluates the expressions init-form-1, init-form-2, and so on,  in that order, saving the resulting values. Then all of the variables varj are bound to the corresponding values; each binding is lexical unless there is a special declaration to the contrary. The expressions formk are then evaluated in order; the values of all but the last are discarded (that is, the body of a let is an implicit progn). 
-let* is similar to let, but the bindings of variables are performed sequentially rather than in parallel. The expression for the init-form of a var can refer to vars previously bound in the let*. 
-The form 
- 
- (let* ((var1 init-form-1)
-        (var2 init-form-2)
-        ...
-        (varm init-form-m))
-   declaration1
-   declaration2
-   ...
-   declarationp
-   form1
-   form2
-   ...
-   formn)
-<TT> first evaluates the expression init-form-1, then binds the variable var1 to that value; then it evaluates init-form-2 and binds  var2, and so on. The expressions formj are then evaluated in order; the values of all but the last are discarded (that is, the body of let* is an implicit progn). 
-For both let and let*, if there is not an init-form associated with a var, var is initialized to nil. 
-The special form let has the property that the scope of the name binding does not include any initial value form. For let*, a variable's scope also includes the remaining initial value forms for subsequent variable bindings. 
-Examples
- 
- (setq a 'top) =>  TOP
- (defun dummy-function () a) =>  DUMMY-FUNCTION
- (let ((a 'inside) (b a))
-    (format nil "~S ~S ~S" a b (dummy-function))) =>  "INSIDE TOP TOP" 
- (let* ((a 'inside) (b a))
-    (format nil "~S ~S ~S" a b (dummy-function))) =>  "INSIDE INSIDE TOP" 
- (let ((a 'inside) (b a))
-    (declare (special a))
-    (format nil "~S ~S ~S" a b (dummy-function))) =>  "INSIDE TOP INSIDE"
-<TT> 
-The code 
- (let (x)
-   (declare (integer x))
-   (setq x (gcd y z))
-   ...)
-<TT> is incorrect; although x is indeed set before it is used, and is set to a value of the declared type integer, nevertheless x initially takes on the value nil in violation of the type declaration.
