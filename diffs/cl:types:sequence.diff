 Description
  
 Sequences are ordered collections of objects, called the elements of the sequence.

+The types vector and the type list are disjoint subtypes of sequence, but are not necessarily an exhaustive partition of sequence.
 When viewing a vector as a sequence, only the active elements of that vector are considered elements of the sequence; that is, sequence operations respect the fill pointer when given sequences represented as vectors.
