 Arguments and Values
  
+
  host - a valid physical pathname host. Complicated defaulting behavior; see below. 
+
 device - a valid pathname device. Complicated defaulting behavior; see below. 
+
 directory - a valid pathname directory. Complicated defaulting behavior; see below. 
+
 name - a valid pathname name. Complicated defaulting behavior; see below. 
+
 type - a valid pathname type. Complicated defaulting behavior; see below. 
+
 version - a valid pathname version. Complicated defaulting behavior; see below.  
+
 defaults - a pathname designator. The default is a pathname whose host component is the same as the host component of the value of *default-pathname-defaults*, and whose other components are all nil. 
+
  case - one of common or local. The default is local.  
+
 pathname - a pathname. 
+
+
+
 Description
  
+
 Constructs and returns a pathname from the supplied keyword arguments. 
+
+
 After the components supplied explicitly by host, device, directory, name, type, and version are filled in, the merging rules used by merge-pathnames are used to fill in any unsupplied components from the defaults supplied by defaults. 
-Whenever a pathname is constructed the components may be canonicalized if appropriate. For the explanation of the arguments that can be supplied for each component, see Section 19.2.1 (Pathname Components). 
- If case is supplied, it is treated as described in Section 19.2.2.1.2 (Case in Pathname Components).

+Whenever a pathname is constructed the components may be canonicalized if appropriate. For the explanation of the arguments that can be supplied for each component, see section {\secref\PathnameComponents}.
+
+
+If case is supplied, it is treated as described in \secref\PathnameComponentCase.
+
+
   The resulting pathname is a logical pathname if and only its host component is a logical host or a string that names a defined logical host.   
+
+
  If the directory is a string, it should be the name of a top level directory, and should not contain any punctuation characters; that is, specifying a string, str, is equivalent to specifying the list (absolute str). Specifying the symbol wild is equivalent to specifying the list (absolute wild-inferiors), or (absolute wild) in a file system that does not support wild-inferiors.
