+Syntax
+ rational  number → rational rationalize number → rational
+Arguments and Values
+ number - a real.
+ rational - a rational.
+Description
+rational and rationalize convert reals to rationals.
+If number is already rational, it is returned.
+If number is a float, rational returns a rational that is mathematically equal in value to the float. rationalize returns a rational that approximates the float to the accuracy of the underlying floating-point representation.
+rational assumes that the float is completely accurate.
+rationalize assumes that the float is accurate only to the precision of the floating-point representation.
+Examples
+(rational 0)
+→
+0
+(rationalize -11/100)
+→
+-11/100
+(rational .1)
+→
+13421773/134217728 ;implementation-dependent
+(rationalize .1)
+→
+1/10
+Side Effects
+None.
+Affected By
+The implementation.
+Exceptional Situations
+Should signal an error of type type-error if number is not a real. Might signal arithmetic-error.
+See Also
+None.
+Notes
+Rationalizing a float by either method and then converting it back to a float of the same format produces the original number.
+(float (rational x) x)
+  ≡ (float (rationalize x) x)
