  pathname - a pathname designator.

 wildcard - a designator for a wild pathname.

 generalized-boolean - a generalized boolean.

 Description
  
+
 pathname-match-p returns true if pathname matches wildcard, otherwise nil. The matching rules are implementation-defined but should be consistent with directory. Missing components of wildcard default to wild. 
-It is valid for pathname to be a wild pathname; a wildcard field in pathname only matches a wildcard field in wildcard (i.e., pathname-match-p is not commutative). It is valid for wildcard to be a non-wild pathname. 
-Examples None.
