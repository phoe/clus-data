 Description
  
-A random state object contains state information used by the pseudo-random number generator. The nature of a random state object is implementation-dependent. It can be printed out and successfully read back in by the same implementation, but might not function correctly as a random state in another implementation.

 Implementations are required to provide a read syntax for objects of type random-state, but the specific nature of that syntax is implementation-dependent.
