 Arguments and Values
  
 string - a string. 
  package - a package designator.  The default is the current package. 
 symbol - a symbol. 
 status - one of inherited, external, internal, or nil. 
 Description
  
 intern enters a symbol named string into package. If a symbol whose name is the same as string is already accessible in package, it is returned. If no such symbol is accessible in package, a new symbol with the given name is created and entered into package as an internal symbol, or as an external symbol if the package is the KEYWORD package; package becomes the home package of the created symbol. 
-The first value returned by intern, symbol, is the symbol that was found or created. The meaning of the secondary value, status, is as follows internal  
+The first value returned by intern, symbol, is the symbol that was found or created.
+The meaning of the secondary value, status, is as follows
+internal
 The symbol was found and is present in package as an internal symbol. 
 external  
 The symbol was found and is present as an external symbol. 
 inherited  
 The symbol was found and is inherited via use-package (which implies that the symbol is internal). 
 nil  
 No pre-existing symbol was found, so one was created. 
 It is implementation-dependent whether the string that becomes the new symbol's name is the given string or a copy of it. Once a string has been given as the string argument to intern in this situation where a new symbol is created, the consequences are undefined if a subsequent attempt is made to alter that string.

 Notes
  
 intern does not need to do any name conflict checking because it never creates a new symbol if there is already an accessible symbol with the name given.
