 integer - an integer. 
 integer-1 - an integer. 
 integer-2 - an integer. 
 result-integer - an integer. 
-Description
  
-The functions logandc1, logandc2, logand, logeqv, logior, lognand, lognor, lognot, logorc1, logorc2, and logxor perform bit-wise logical operations on their arguments, that are treated as if they were binary. 
-The next figure lists the meaning of each of the functions. Where an `identity' is shown, it indicates the value yielded by the function when no arguments are supplied.
