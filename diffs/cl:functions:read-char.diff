 Arguments and Values

 input-stream - an input stream designator. The default is standard input.
 eof-error-p - a generalized boolean. The default is true.
  eof-value - an object. The default is nil.
 recursive-p - a generalized boolean. The default is false.
 char - a character or the eof-value.
 Description

 read-char returns the next character from input-stream.
  When input-stream is an echo stream, the character is echoed on input-stream the first time the character is seen. Characters that are not echoed by read-char are those that were put there by unread-char and hence are assumed to have been echoed already by a previous call to read-char.
  If recursive-p is true, this call is expected to be embedded in a higher-level call to read or a similar function used by the Lisp reader.
-If an end of file[2] occurs and eof-error-p is false, eof-value is returned.
+If an end of file occurs and eof-error-p is false, eof-value is returned.

 Exceptional Situations

-If an end of file[2] occurs before a character can be read, and eof-error-p is true, an error of type end-of-file is signaled.
