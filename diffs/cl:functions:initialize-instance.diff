 initialize-instance (instance standard-object) &rest initargs
  
 Arguments and Values
  
 instance - an object. 
 initargs - a defaulted initialization argument list. 
 Description
  
 Called by make-instance to initialize a newly created instance. The generic function is called with the new instance and the defaulted initialization argument list. 
 The system-supplied primary method on initialize-instance initializes the slots of the instance with values according to the initargs and the initform forms of the slots. It does this by calling the generic function shared-initialize with the following arguments the instance, t (this indicates that all slots for which no initialization arguments are provided should be initialized according to their initform forms), and the initargs. 
 Programmers can define methods for initialize-instance to specify actions to be taken when an instance is initialized. If only after methods are defined, they will be run after the system-supplied primary method for initialization and therefore will not interfere with the default behavior of initialize-instance.
