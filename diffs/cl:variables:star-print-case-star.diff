 Variable *PRINT-CASE* 
 Value Type
  
 One of the symbols upcase, downcase, or capitalize. 
 Initial Value
  
 The symbol upcase. 
 Description
  
 The value of *print-case* controls the case (upper, lower, or mixed) in which to print any uppercase characters in the names of symbols when vertical-bar syntax is not used. 
-  *print-case* has an effect at all times when the value of *print-escape* is false. *print-case* also has an effect when the value of *print-escape* is true unless inside an escape context (i.e., unless between vertical-bars or after a slash).

 Examples
  
 
+Although the choice of which characters to escape is specified by *print-case*, the choice of how to escape those haracters (i.e., whether single escapes or multiple escapes are used) is implementation-dependent. The examples here show two of the many valid ways in which escaping might appear.

 Notes
  
 read normally converts lowercase characters appearing in symbols to corresponding uppercase characters, so that internally print names normally contain only uppercase characters. 
-If *print-escape* is true, lowercase characters in the name of a symbol are always printed in lowercase, and are preceded by a single escape character or enclosed by multiple escape characters; uppercase characters in the name of a symbol are printed in upper case, in lower case, or in mixed case so as to capitalize words, according to the value of *print-case*. The convention for what constitutes a ``word'' is the same as for string-capitalize.
