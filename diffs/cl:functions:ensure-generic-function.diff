 Arguments and Values
  
 function-name - a function name. 
 The keyword arguments correspond to the option arguments of defgeneric, except that the method-class and generic-function-class arguments can be class objects as well as names. 
-Method-combination -- method combination object. 
-Environment -- the same as the &environment argument to macro expansion functions and is used to distinguish between compile-time and run-time environments. 
+ method-combination - method combination object.
+ environment - the same as the &environment argument to macro expansion functions and is used to distinguish between compile-time and run-time environments.
  generic-function - a generic function object. 
 Description
  
 The function ensure-generic-function is used to define a globally named generic function with no methods or to specify or modify options and declarations that pertain to a globally named generic function as a whole. 
-If function-name is not fbound in the global environment, a new generic function is created. If  (fdefinition function-name)  is an ordinary function, a macro, or a special operator, an error is signaled. 
+If function-name is not fbound in the global environment, a new generic function is created.
+If (fdefinition function-name) is an ordinary function, a macro, or a special operator, an error is signaled.
 If function-name is a list, it must be of the form (setf symbol). If function-name specifies a generic function that has a different value for any of the following arguments, the generic function is modified to have the new value argument-precedence-order, declare, documentation, method-combination. 
 If function-name specifies a generic function that has a different value for the lambda-list argument, and the new value is congruent with the lambda lists of all existing methods or there are no methods, the value is changed; otherwise an error is signaled. 
 If function-name specifies a generic function that has a different value for the generic-function-class argument and if the new generic function class is compatible with the old, change-class is called to change the class of the generic function; otherwise an error is signaled. 
 If function-name specifies a generic function that has a different value for the method-class argument, the value is changed, but any existing methods are not changed.
