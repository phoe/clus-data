 Syntax
  
 
-shadow symbol-names &optional package => t
+ shadow symbol-names &optional package → t
+====Arguments and Values====
+* symbol-names - a designator for a list of symbol name designators.
+* package - a package designator. The default is the current package.
+====Description====
+shadow assures that symbols with names given by symbol-names are present in the package.
+Specifically, package is searched for symbols with the names supplied by symbol-names.
+For each such name, if a corresponding symbol is not present in package (directly, not by inheritance), then a corresponding symbol is created with that name, and inserted into package as an internal symbol. The corresponding symbol, whether pre-existing or newly created, is then added, if not already present, to the shadowing symbols list of package.
+====Examples====
+<blockquote>
+(package-shadowing-symbols (make-package 'temp use '(cl))) <r>NIL </r>
+(find-symbol "CAR" 'temp) <r>CAR
+INHERITED </r>
+(shadow 'car 'temp) <r>T </r>
+(find-symbol "CAR" 'temp) <r>TEMPCAR
+INTERNAL </r>
+(package-shadowing-symbols 'temp) <r>(TEMPCAR)</r>
+</blockquote>
+<blockquote>
+(make-package 'test-1) <r>#<PACKAGE "TEST-1"></r>
+(intern "TEST" (find-package 'test-1)) <r>TEST-1TEST, NIL</r>
+(shadow 'test-1test (find-package 'test-1)) <r>T</r>
+(shadow 'TEST (find-package 'test-1)) <r>T</r>
+(assert (not (null (member 'test-1test
+(package-shadowing-symbols (find-package 'test-1))))))
+<r>NIL</r>
+(make-package 'test-2) <r>#<PACKAGE "TEST-2"></r>
+(intern "TEST" (find-package 'test-2)) <r>TEST-2TEST, NIL</r>
+(export 'test-2test (find-package 'test-2)) <r>T</r>
+(use-package 'test-2 (find-package 'test-1)) <r>T</r>
+</blockquote>
+The use-package call in the above example does not error, because the symbol with name "TEST" is shadowed in the package test-1. Therefore, that symbol is not found via inheritance from package test-2'' and there is no conflict between symbols with the same name.

 Notes
  
-If a symbol with a name in symbol-names already exists in package, but by inheritance, the inherited symbol becomes shadowed[3] by a newly created internal symbol.
