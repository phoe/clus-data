 Arguments and Values
  
 pathname - a pathname designator. 
 Description
  
 Either binds *standard-input* and *standard-output* or takes other appropriate action, so as to send a record of the input/output interaction to a file named by pathname. dribble is intended to create a readable record of an interactive session. 
  If pathname is a logical pathname, it is translated into a physical pathname as if by calling translate-logical-pathname.  
 (dribble) terminates the recording of input and output and closes the dribble file. 
- If dribble is called while a stream to a ``dribble file'' is still open from a previous call to dribble, the effect is implementation-defined. For example, the already-open stream might be closed, or dribbling might occur both to the old stream and to a new one, or the old stream might stay open but not receive any further output, or the new request might be ignored, or some other action might be taken.  
-Examples None.

 Exceptional Situations
  
  If a failure occurs when performing some operation on the file system while creating the dribble file, an error of type file-error is signaled.  
  An error of type file-error might be signaled if pathname is a designator for a wild pathname.

 Notes
  
   
 dribble can return before subsequent forms are executed. It also can enter a recursive interaction loop, returning only when (dribble) is done.
