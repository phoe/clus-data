 Arguments and Values
  
 instance - an object. 
 initargs - an initialization argument list. 
 Description
  
-The generic function reinitialize-instance can be used to change the values of local slots of an instance according to initargs. This generic function can be called by users. 
+The generic function reinitialize-instance can be used to change the values of local slots of an instance according to initargs.
+This generic function can be called by users.
 The system-supplied primary method for reinitialize-instance checks the validity of initargs and signals an error if an initarg is supplied that is not declared as valid. The method then calls the generic function shared-initialize with the following arguments the instance, nil (which means no slots should be initialized according to their initforms), and the initargs it received.

 Notes
  
 Initargs are declared as valid by using the initarg option to defclass, or by defining methods for reinitialize-instance or shared-initialize. The keyword name of each keyword parameter specifier in the lambda list of any method defined on reinitialize-instance or shared-initialize is declared as a valid initialization argument name for all classes for which that method is applicable.
