 Arguments and Values

 sequence - a proper sequence.
 reversed-sequence - a sequence.
 Description

 reverse and nreverse return a new sequence of the same kind as sequence, containing the same elements, but in reverse order.
 reverse and nreverse differ in that reverse always creates and returns a new sequence, whereas nreverse might modify and return the given sequence. reverse never modifies the given sequence.
 For reverse, if sequence is a vector, the result is a fresh simple array of rank one that has the same actual array element type as sequence. If sequence is a list, the result is a fresh list.
 For nreverse, if sequence is a vector, the result is a vector that has the same actual array element type as sequence. If sequence is a list, the result is a list.
-For nreverse, sequence might be destroyed and re-used to produce the result. The result might or might not be identical to sequence.  Specifically, when sequence is a list, nreverse is permitted to setf any part, car or cdr, of any cons that is part of the list structure of sequence. When sequence is a vector, nreverse is permitted to re-order the elements of sequence in order to produce the resulting vector.

 Examples


- (setq str "abc") =>  "abc"
- (reverse str) =>  "cba"
- str =>  "abc"
- (setq str (copy-seq str)) =>  "abc"
- (nreverse str) =>  "cba"
- str =>  implementation-dependent
- (setq l (list 1 2 3)) =>  (1 2 3)
- (nreverse l) =>  (3 2 1)
- l =>  implementation-dependent
