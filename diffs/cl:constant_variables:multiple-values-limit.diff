 Constant Variable MULTIPLE-VALUES-LIMIT 
 Constant Value
  
 An integer not smaller than 20, the exact magnitude of which is implementation-dependent. 
 Description
  
-The upper exclusive bound on the number of values that may be returned from a function,  bound or assigned by multiple-value-bind or multiple-value-setq, or passed as a first argument to nth-value. (If these individual limits might differ, the minimum value is used.)  
-Examples None.
