 If no slot of the name slot-name exists in the instance, slot-missing is called as follows 
 
- (slot-missing (class-of instance)
-               instance
-               slot-name
-               'slot-boundp)

  (If slot-missing is invoked and returns a value, a boolean equivalent to its primary value is returned by slot-boundp.)  
- The specific behavior depends on instance's metaclass. An error is never signaled if instance has metaclass standard-class. An error is always signaled if instance has metaclass built-in-class. The consequences are undefined if instance has any other metaclass--an error might or might not be signaled in this situation. Note in particular that the behavior for conditions and structures is not specified.

 Notes
  
+
 The function slot-boundp allows for writing after methods on initialize-instance in order to initialize only those slots that have not already been bound. 
+
+
  Although no implementation is required to do so, implementors are strongly encouraged to implement the function slot-boundp using the function slot-boundp-using-class described in the Metaobject Protocol.
