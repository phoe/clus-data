 Syntax
  
 
-provide module-name => implementation-dependent
+ provide module-name → implementation-dependent
+ require module-name &optional pathname-list → implementation-dependent
   
-require module-name &optional pathname-list => implementation-dependent
   
 Arguments and Values
  
-module-name - a string designator. 
+ module-name - a symbol name designator.
  pathname-list - nil, or a designator for a non-empty list of pathname designators. The default is nil.  
 Description
  
 provide adds the module-name to the list held by *modules*, if such a name is not already present. 
-require tests for the presence of the module-name in the list held by *modules*. If it is present, require immediately returns.  Otherwise, an attempt is made to load an appropriate set of files as follows The pathname-list argument, if non-nil, specifies a list of pathnames to be loaded in order, from left to right. If the pathname-list is nil, an implementation-dependent mechanism will be invoked in an attempt to load the module named module-name; if no such module can be loaded, an error of type error is signaled.  
-Both functions use string= to test for the presence of a module-name.

 Examples
  
  
+This illustrates a non-portable use of require, because it depends on the implementation-dependent file-loading mechanism.

-<TT>  
 Side Effects
  
 provide modifies *modules*. 
 Affected By
  
 The specific action taken by require is affected by calls to provide (or, in general, any changes to the value of *modules*). 
 Exceptional Situations
  
-Should signal an error of type type-error if module-name is not a string designator. 
+Should signal an error of type type-error if module-name is not a symbol name designator.
  If require fails to perform the requested operation due to a problem while interacting with the file system, an error of type file-error is signaled.  
  An error of type file-error might be signaled if any pathname in pathname-list is a designator for a wild pathname.

 Notes
  
 The functions provide and require are deprecated. 
 If a module consists of a single package, it is customary for the package and module names to be the same.
