 This is the normal mechanism for defining a compiler macro function. Its manner of definition is the same as for defmacro; the only differences are
-*  The name can be a function name naming any function or macro.
-*  The expander function is installed as a compiler macro function for the name, rather than as a macro function.
-*  The &whole argument is bound to the form argument that is passed to the compiler macro function. The remaining lambda-list parameters are specified as if this form contained the function name in the car and the actual arguments in the cdr, but if the car of the actual form is the symbol funcall, then the destructuring of the arguments is actually performed using its cddr instead.
-*  Documentation is attached as a documentation string to name (as kind compiler-macro) and to the compiler macro function.
-*  Unlike an ordinary macro, a compiler macro can decline to provide an expansion merely by returning a form that is the same as the original (which can be obtained by using &whole).

 Notes

-The consequences of writing a compiler macro definition for a function in the COMMON-LISP package are undefined; it is quite possible that in some implementations such an attempt would override an equivalent or equally important definition. In general, it is recommended that a programmer only write compiler macro definitions for functions he or she personally maintains--writing a compiler macro definition for a function maintained elsewhere is normally considered a violation of traditional rules of modularity and data abstraction.
