 Syntax
  
 
-pop place => element
+ pop place → element
  
 Arguments and Values
  
- place - a place, the value of which is a list (possibly, but necessarily, a dotted list or circular list).  
-element - an object (the car of the contents of place). 
+ place---a place, the value of which is a list (possibly, but necessarily, a dotted list or circular list).
+ element---an object (the car of the contents of place).
 Description
  
 pop reads the value of place, remembers the car of the list which was retrieved, writes the cdr of the list back into the place, and finally yields the car of the originally retrieved list. 
- For information about the evaluation of subforms of place, see Section 5.1.1.1 (Evaluation of Subforms to Places).  
+For information about the evaluation of subforms of place, \seesection\GenRefSubFormEval.
 Examples
  
 
- (setq stack '(a b c)) =>  (A B C)
- (pop stack) =>  A  
- stack =>  (B C)
- (setq llst '((1 2 3 4))) =>  ((1 2 3 4))
- (pop (car llst)) =>  1
- llst =>  ((2 3 4))
