 Arguments and Values
  
 tag - a catch tag; evaluated. 
-result-form - a form; evaluated as described below. 
+ result-form - a form; evaluatedspecial.
 Description
  
 throw causes a non-local control transfer to a catch whose tag is eq to tag. 
 Tag is evaluated first to produce an object called the throw tag; then result-form is evaluated, and its results are saved. If the result-form produces multiple values, then all the values are saved. The most recent outstanding catch whose tag is eq to the throw tag is exited; the saved results are returned as the value or values of catch. 
-The transfer of control initiated by throw is performed as described in Section 5.2 (Transfer of Control to an Exit Point). 
+The transfer of control initiated by throw is performed as described in \secref\TransferOfControl.

 Exceptional Situations
  
 If there is no outstanding catch tag that matches the throw tag, no unwinding of the stack is performed, and an error of type control-error is signaled. When the error is signaled, the dynamic environment is that which was in force at the point of the throw.

 Notes
  
-catch and throw are normally used when the exit point must have dynamic scope (e.g., the throw is not lexically enclosed by the catch), while block and return are used when lexical scope is sufficient.
