 Arguments and Values
  
 disp-char - a character. 
 sub-char - a character. 
  readtable - a readtable designator.  The default is the current readtable. 
 function - a function designator or nil. 
 new-function - a function designator. 
 Description
  
-set-dispatch-macro-character causes new-function to be called when disp-char followed by sub-char is read. If sub-char is a lowercase letter, it is converted to its uppercase equivalent. It is an error if sub-char is one of the ten decimal digits. 
+set-dispatch-macro-character causes new-function to be called when disp-char followed by sub-char is read.
+If sub-char is a lowercase letter, it is converted to its uppercase equivalent. It is an error if sub-char is one of the ten decimal digits.
 set-dispatch-macro-character installs a new-function to be called when a particular dispatching macro character pair is read. New-function is installed as the dispatch function to be called when readtable is in use and when disp-char is followed by sub-char. 
-For more information about how the new-function is invoked, see Section 2.1.4.4 (Macro Characters). 
+For more information about how the new-function is invoked, see section {\secref\MacroChars}.
 get-dispatch-macro-character retrieves the dispatch function associated with disp-char and sub-char in readtable. 
 get-dispatch-macro-character returns the macro-character function for sub-char under disp-char, or nil if there is no function associated with sub-char. If sub-char is a decimal digit, get-dispatch-macro-character returns nil.

 Notes
  It is necessary to use make-dispatch-macro-character to set up the dispatch character before specifying its sub-characters.
