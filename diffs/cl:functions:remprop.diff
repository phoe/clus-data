 Description
  
-remprop removes from the property list[2] of symbol a property[1] with a property indicator identical to indicator.  If there are multiple properties[1] with the identical key, remprop only removes the first such property.  remprop returns false if no such property was found, or true if a property was found. 
-The property indicator and the corresponding property value are removed in an undefined order by destructively splicing the property list.  The permissible side-effects correspond to those permitted for remf, such that

 Notes
  
+
 Numbers and characters are not recommended for use as indicators in portable code since remprop tests with eq rather than eql, and consequently the effect of using such indicators is implementation-dependent. Of course, if you've gotten as far as needing to remove such a property, you don't have much choice - the time to have been thinking about this was when you used setf of get to establish the property.
