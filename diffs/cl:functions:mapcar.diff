 Arguments and Values
  
+
 function - a designator for a function that must take as many arguments as there are lists. 
+
  list - a proper list. 
+
 list-1 - the first list (which must be a proper list).  
+
 result-list - a list. 
+
 concatenated-results - a list. 
+
+
+
 Description
  
+
 The mapping operation involves applying function to successive sets of arguments in which one argument is obtained from each sequence. Except for mapc and mapl, the result contains the results returned by function. In the cases of mapc and mapl, the resulting sequence is list. 
+
+
 function is called first on all the elements with index 0, then on all those with index 1, and so on. result-type specifies the type of the resulting sequence.  If function is a symbol, it is coerced to a function as if by symbol-function.  
+
+
 mapcar operates on successive elements of the lists. function is applied to the first element of each list, then to the second element of each list, and so on. The iteration terminates when the shortest list runs out, and excess elements in other lists are ignored. The value returned by mapcar is a list of the results of successive calls to function. 
+
+
 mapc is like mapcar except that the results of applying function are not accumulated. The list argument is returned. 
+
+
 maplist is like mapcar except that function is applied to successive sublists of the lists. function is first applied to the lists themselves, and then to the cdr of each list, and then to the cdr of the cdr of each list, and so on. 
+
+
 mapl is like maplist except that the results of applying function are not accumulated; list-1 is returned. 
+
+
 mapcan and mapcon are like mapcar and maplist respectively, except that the results of applying function are combined into a list by the use of nconc rather than list. That is, 
 
- (mapcon f x1 ... xn)
-   ==  (apply #'nconc (maplist f x1 ... xn))
 
-<TT> and similarly for the relationship between mapcan and mapcar.

+(mapcon f x1 ... xn) ≡ (apply #'nconc (maplist f x1 ... xn))
