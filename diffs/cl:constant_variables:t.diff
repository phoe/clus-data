+Constant Variable T
+Constant Value
+t.
+Description
+The boolean representing true, and the canonical generalized boolean representing true. Although any object other than nil is considered true, t is generally used when there is no special reason to prefer one such object over another.
+The symbol t is also sometimes used for other purposes as well. For example, as the name of a class, as a designator (e.g. a stream designator) or as a special symbol for some syntactic reason (e.g. in case and typecase to label the otherwise-clause).
