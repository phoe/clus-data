 Type BOOLEAN 
 Supertypes
  
 boolean, symbol, t 
 Description
  
 The type boolean contains the symbols t and nil, which represent true and false, respectively. 
 See Also
  
-t (constant variable), nil (constant variable), if, not, complement 
+ Constant Variable T
+ Constant Variable NIL
+ Special Operator IF
+ Function NOT
+ Function COMPLEMENT
 Notes
  
 Conditional operations, such as if, permit the use of generalized booleans, not just booleans; any non-nil value, not just t, counts as true for a generalized boolean. However, as a matter of convention, the symbol t is considered the canonical value to use even for a generalized boolean when no better choice presents itself.
