+Compound Type Specifier Description
+
+
+This denotes the set containing the named objects. An object is of this type if and only if it is eql to one of the specified objects.
+
+
+The type specifiers (member) and nil are equivalent. * can be among the objects, but if so it denotes itself (the symbol *) and does not represent an unspecified value. The symbol member is not valid as a type specifier; and, specifically, it is not an abbreviation for either (member) or (member *).
