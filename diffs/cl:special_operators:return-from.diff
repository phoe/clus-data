 name - a block tag; not evaluated. 
 result - a form; evaluated. The default is nil. 
 Description
  
-Returns control and multiple values[2] from a lexically enclosing block. 
+Returns control and multiple values from a lexically enclosing block.
 A block form named name must lexically enclose the occurrence of return-from; any values yielded by the evaluation of result are immediately returned from the innermost such lexically enclosing block. 
-The transfer of control initiated by return-from is performed as described in Section 5.2 (Transfer of Control to an Exit Point). 
+The transfer of control initiated by return-from is performed as described in \secref\TransferOfControl.
