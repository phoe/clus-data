 Arguments and Values
  
 input-stream -- an input stream designator. The default is standard input. 
 eof-error-p - a generalized boolean. The default is true. 
  eof-value - an object. The default is nil.  
 recursive-p - a generalized boolean. The default is false. 
 char - a character or nil or the eof-value. 
 Description
  
 read-char-no-hang returns a character from input-stream if such a character is available. If no character is available, read-char-no-hang returns nil. 
  If recursive-p is true, this call is expected to be embedded in a higher-level call to read or a similar function used by the Lisp reader. 
-If an end of file[2] occurs and eof-error-p is false, eof-value is returned. 
+If an end of file occurs and eof-error-p is false, eof-value is returned.
 Examples
  
 
-;; This code assumes an implementation in which a newline is not
-;; required to terminate input from the console.
  (defun test-it ()
    (unread-char (read-char))
    (list (read-char-no-hang)

          (read-char-no-hang)))

-;; interactive input on the console.

 Exceptional Situations
  
-If an end of file[2] occurs when eof-error-p is true, an error of type end-of-file is signaled . 
+If an end of file occurs when eof-error-p is true, an error of type end-of-file is signaled .

 Notes
  
 read-char-no-hang is exactly like read-char, except that if it would be necessary to wait in order to get a character (as from a keyboard), nil is immediately returned without waiting.
