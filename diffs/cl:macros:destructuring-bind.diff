 Arguments and Values

 lambda-list - a destructuring lambda list.
 expression - a form.
 declaration - a declare expression; not evaluated.
 forms - an implicit progn.
 results - the values returned by the forms.
 Description

 destructuring-bind binds the variables specified in lambda-list to the corresponding values in the tree structure resulting from the evaluation of expression; then destructuring-bind evaluates forms.
-The lambda-list supports destructuring as described in Section 3.4.5 (Destructuring Lambda Lists).
+The lambda-list supports destructuring as described in \secref\DestructuringLambdaLists.
 Examples
