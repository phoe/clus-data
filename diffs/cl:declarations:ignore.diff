 Declaration IGNORE, IGNORABLE 
  
 Syntax
  
-(ignore {var | (function<A> fn)}*) 
-(ignorable {var | (function<A> fn)}*) 
+ (ignore {var | (function fn)}*)
+ (ignorable {var | (function fn)}*)
 Arguments
  
 var - a variable name. 
 fn - a function name. 
 Valid Context
  
 declaration 
 Binding Types Affected
  
 variable, function 
-Description
  
- The ignore and ignorable declarations refer to for-value references to variable bindings for the vars and to function bindings for the fns. 
-An ignore declaration specifies that for-value references to the indicated bindings will not occur within the scope of the declaration. Within the scope of such a declaration, it is desirable for a compiler to issue a warning about the presence of either a for-value reference to any var or fn, or a special declaration for any var. 
-An ignorable declaration specifies that for-value references to the indicated bindings might or might not occur within the scope of the declaration. Within the scope of such a declaration, it is not desirable for a compiler to issue a warning about the presence or absence of either a for-value reference to any var or fn, or a special declaration for any var. 
-When not within the scope of a ignore or ignorable declaration, it is desirable for a compiler to issue a warning about any var for which there is neither a for-value reference nor a special declaration, or about any fn for which there is no for-value reference. 
-Any warning about a ``used'' or ``unused'' binding must be of type style-warning, and may not affect program semantics. 
  
-The stream variables established by with-open-file, with-open-stream, with-input-from-string, and with-output-to-string, and all iteration variables are, by definition, always ``used''. Using (declare (ignore v)), for such a variable v has unspecified consequences.
