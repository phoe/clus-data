 generalized-boolean - a generalized boolean.

 Description
  
+
 The locally defined function next-method-p can be used  within the body forms (but not the lambda list)  defined by a method-defining form to determine whether a next method exists. 
+
+
 The function next-method-p has lexical scope and indefinite extent. 
+
+
  Whether or not next-method-p is fbound in the global environment is implementation-dependent; however, the restrictions on redefinition and shadowing of next-method-p are the same as for symbols in the COMMON-LISP package which are fbound in the global environment. The consequences of attempting to use next-method-p outside of a method-defining form are undefined.
