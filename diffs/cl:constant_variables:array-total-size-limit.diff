 Constant Variable ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE-LIMIT 
-Constant Value
  
-A positive  fixnum,  the exact magnitude of which is implementation-dependent, but which is not less than 1024. 
-Description
  
 The upper exclusive bound on the array total size of an array. 
+
+
 The actual limit on the array total size imposed by the implementation might vary according the element type of the array; in this case, the value of array-total-size-limit will be the smallest of these possible limits. 
-Examples None.
