 Arguments and Values
  
+
  filespec - a pathname designator.  
+
  truename - a physical pathname.  
+
+
+
 Description
  
-truename tries to find the file indicated by filespec and returns its truename. If the filespec designator is an open stream, its associated file is used.  If filespec is a stream, truename can be used whether the stream is open or closed. It is permissible for truename to return more specific information after the stream is closed than when the stream was open.  If filespec is a pathname it represents the name used to open the file. This may be, but is not required to be, the actual name of the file.
