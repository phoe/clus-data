 Arguments and Values

  result-type - a sequence type specifier.
 sequences - a sequence.
 result-sequence - a proper sequence of type result-type.
 Description

-concatenate returns a sequence that contains all the individual elements of all the sequences in the order that they are supplied. The sequence is of type result-type, which must be a subtype of type sequence.
-All of the sequences are copied from; the result does not share any structure with any of the sequences. Therefore, if only one sequence is provided and it is of type result-type, concatenate is required to copy sequence rather than simply returning it.
-It is an error if any element of the sequences cannot be an element of the sequence result.   If the result-type is a subtype of list, the result will be a list.

+If the result-type is a subtype of list,the result will be a list.
 If the result-type is a subtype of vector, then if the implementation can determine the element type specified for the result-type, the element type of the resulting array is the result of upgrading that element type; or, if the implementation can determine that the element type is unspecified (or *), the element type of the resulting array is t; otherwise, an error is signaled.

 Exceptional Situations

  An error is signaled if the result-type is neither a recognizable subtype of list, nor a recognizable subtype of vector.
  An error of type type-error should be signaled if result-type specifies the number of elements and the sum of sequences is different from that number.
