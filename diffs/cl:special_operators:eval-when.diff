 Arguments and Values
  
  situation - One of the symbols compile-toplevel, load-toplevel, execute, compile, load, or eval. 
-The use of eval, compile, and load is deprecated.    
 forms - an implicit progn. 
 results - the values of the forms if they are executed, or nil if they are not. 
+The use of eval, compile, and load is deprecated.
 Description
  
  The body of an eval-when form is processed as an implicit progn, but only in the situations listed. 
- The use of the situations compile-toplevel (or compile) and load-toplevel (or load) controls whether and when evaluation occurs when eval-when appears as a top level form in code processed by compile-file. See Section 3.2.3 (File Compilation). 
+The use of the situations compile-toplevel (or compile) and load-toplevel (or load) controls whether and when evaluation occurs when eval-when appears as a top level form in code processed by compile-file; see section {\secref\FileCompilation}.
 The use of the situation execute (or eval) controls whether evaluation occurs for other eval-when forms; that is, those that are not top level forms, or those in code processed by eval or compile. If the execute situation is specified in such a form, then the body forms are processed as an implicit progn; otherwise, the eval-when form returns nil. 
  
- eval-when normally appears as a top level form, but it is meaningful for it to appear as a non-top-level form. However, the compile-time side effects described in Section 3.2 (Compilation) only take place when eval-when appears as a top level form.

 Examples
  
 One example of the use of eval-when is that for the compiler to be able to read a file properly when it uses user-defined reader macros, it is necessary to write 
 
  (eval-when (compile-toplevel load-toplevel execute)
-   (set-macro-character #\$ #'(lambda (stream char)
+  (set-macro-character #\$ 
+    #'(lambda (stream char)
                                 (declare (ignore char))
-                                (list 'dollar (read stream))))) =>  T
+        (list 'dollar (read stream)))))
 
-<TT> This causes the call to set-macro-character to be executed in the compiler's execution environment, thereby modifying its reader syntax table.

 Notes
  
  The following effects are logical consequences of the definition of eval-when 
-*  Execution of a single eval-when expression executes the body code at most once. 
-*  Macros intended for use in top level forms should be written so that side-effects are done by the forms in the macro expansion. The macro-expander itself should not do the side-effects.
