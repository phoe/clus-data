 Arguments and Values
  
 place - a place. 
  environment - an environment object.  
 vars, vals, store-vars, writer-form, reader-form - a setf expansion. 
 Description
  
-Determines five values constituting the setf expansion for place in environment; see Section 5.1.1.2 (Setf Expansions). 
+Determines five values constituting the setf expansion for place in environment; see section {\secref\SetfExpansions}.
