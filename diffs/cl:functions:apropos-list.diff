+
+ apropos-list string &optional package → symbols

 Arguments and Values
  
-string - a string designator. 
+
+ string - a symbol name designator.
+
 package - a package designator or nil. The default is nil. 
+
 symbols - a list of symbols. 
+
+
+
 Description
  
+
 These functions search for interned symbols whose names contain the substring string. 
+
+
 For apropos, as each such symbol is found, its name is printed on standard output. In addition, if such a symbol is defined as a function or dynamic variable, information about those definitions might also be printed. 
+
+
 For apropos-list, no output occurs as the search proceeds; instead a list of the matching symbols is returned when the search is complete. 
+
+
 If package is non-nil, only the symbols accessible in that package are searched; otherwise all symbols accessible in any package are searched. 
+
+
 Because a symbol might be available by way of more than one inheritance path, apropos might print information about the same symbol more than once, or apropos-list might return a list containing duplicate symbols. 
+
+
 Whether or not the search is case-sensitive is implementation-defined.
