 Description
  
  
-In some containing form, F, this declaration asserts for each vari (which need not be bound by F), and for each value vij that vari takes on, and for each object xijk that is an otherwise inaccessible part of vij at any time when vij becomes the value of vari, that just after the execution of F terminates, xijk is either inaccessible (if F established a binding for vari) or still an otherwise inaccessible part of the current value of vari (if F did not establish a binding for vari).  The same relation holds for each fni, except that the bindings are in the function namespace.

 The compiler is permitted to use this information in any way that is appropriate to the implementation and that does not conflict with the semantics of Common Lisp. 
+
+
 dynamic-extent declarations can be free declarations or bound declarations. 
+
+
  The vars and fns named in a dynamic-extent declaration must not refer to symbol macro or macro bindings.

 Examples
  
+
 Since stack allocation of the initial value entails knowing at the object's creation time that the object can be stack-allocated, it is not generally useful to make a dynamic-extent declaration for variables which have no lexically apparent initial value. For example, it is probably useful to write 
 
+
+
  (defun f ()
    (let ((x (list 1 2 3)))
      (declare (dynamic-extent x))
@@ -28,36 +59,73 @@

 This would permit those compilers that wish to do so to stack allocate the list held by the local variable x. It is permissible, but in practice probably not as useful, to write 
 
- (defun g (x) (declare (dynamic-extent x)) ...)
- (defun f () (g (list 1 2 3)))
 
-<TT> 
+
+(defun g (x)
+  (declare (dynamic-extent x)) 
+  ...)
+
+
+
+(defun f ()
+  (g (list 1 2 3)))
+
+
+
 Most compilers would probably not stack allocate the argument to g in f because it would be a modularity violation for the compiler to assume facts about g from within f. Only an implementation that was willing to be responsible for recompiling f if the definition of g changed incompatibly could legitimately stack allocate the list argument to g in f. 
+
+
 Here is another example 
 
+
+
  (declaim (inline g))
- (defun g (x) (declare (dynamic-extent x)) ...)
- (defun f () (g (list 1 2 3)))
+
+
+
+(defun g (x)
+  (declare (dynamic-extent x)) 
+  ...)
+
+
  
  (defun f ()
-   (flet ((g (x) (declare (dynamic-extent x)) ...))
+  (g (list 1 2 3)))
+
+
+
+(defun f ()
+  (flet ((g (x)
+           (declare (dynamic-extent x)) 
+           ...))
      (g (list 1 2 3))))

 Note that although the initial value of x is not explicit, the f function is responsible for assembling the list x from the passed arguments, so the f function can be optimized by the compiler to construct a stack-allocated list instead of a heap-allocated list in implementations that support such.

 Notes

 The most common optimization is to stack allocate the initial value of the objects named by the vars. 
+
+

 It is permissible for an implementation to simply ignore this declaration.
