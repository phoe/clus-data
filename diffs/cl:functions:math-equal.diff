 Arguments and Values

 number - for <, >, <=, >= a real; for =, /= a number.
 generalized-boolean - a generalized boolean.
 Description

 =, /=, <, >, <=, and >= perform arithmetic comparisons on their arguments as follows
-=
+<nowiki>=</nowiki>
 The value of = is true if all numbers are the same in value; otherwise it is false. Two complexes are considered equal by = if their real and imaginary parts are equal according to =.
-/=
+<nowiki>/=</nowiki>
 The value of /= is true if no two numbers are the same in value; otherwise it is false.
-<
+<nowiki><</nowiki>
 The value of < is true if the numbers are in monotonically increasing order; otherwise it is false.
->
+<nowiki>></nowiki>
 The value of > is true if the numbers are in monotonically decreasing order; otherwise it is false.
-<=
+<nowiki><=</nowiki>
 The value of <= is true if the numbers are in monotonically nondecreasing order; otherwise it is false.
->=
+<nowiki>>=</nowiki>
The value of >= is true if the numbers are in monotonically nonincreasing order; otherwise it is false.
 =, /=, <, >, <=, and >= perform necessary type conversions.
