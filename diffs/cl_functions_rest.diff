 Arguments and Values

 list - a list,  which might be a dotted list or a circular list.

- (rest list) ==  (cdr list)
- (setf (rest list) new-tail) ==  (setf (cdr list) new-tail)

-<TT>
+ (rest list) ≡ (cdr list)
+ (setf (rest list) new-tail) ≡ (setf (cdr list) new-tail)
 Examples


- (rest '(1 2)) =>  (2)
- (rest '(1 . 2)) =>  2
- (rest '(1)) =>  NIL
- (setq *cons* '(1 . 2)) =>  (1 . 2)
- (setf (rest *cons*) "two") =>  "two"
- *cons* =>  (1 . "two")
