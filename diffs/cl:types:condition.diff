 Condition Type CONDITION 
    
 Class Precedence List
  condition, t 
 Description
  
 All types of conditions, whether error or non-error, must inherit from this type.     
-No additional subtype relationships among the specified subtypes of type condition are allowed, except when explicitly mentioned in the text; however implementations are permitted to introduce additional types and one of these types can be a subtype of any number of the subtypes of type condition. 
+No additional subtype relationships among the specified subtypes of condition are allowed, except when explicitly mentioned in the text; however implementations are permitted to introduce additional types and one of these types can be a subtype of any number of the subtypes of condition.
  Whether a user-defined condition type has slots that are accessible by with-slots is implementation-dependent. Furthermore, even in an implementation in which user-defined condition types would have slots, it is implementation-dependent whether any condition types defined in this document have such slots or, if they do, what their names might be; only the reader functions documented by this specification may be relied upon by portable code.  
  Conforming code must observe the following restrictions related to conditions 
 *  define-condition, not defclass, must be used to define new condition types. 
 *  make-condition, not make-instance, must be used to create condition objects explicitly. 
 *  The report option of define-condition, not defmethod for print-object, must be used to define a condition reporter. 
-*  slot-value, slot-boundp, slot-makunbound, and with-slots must not be used on condition objects. Instead, the appropriate accessor functions (defined by define-condition) should be used.
