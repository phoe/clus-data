 Description
  
-The value of each of the constants short-float-epsilon, single-float-epsilon, double-float-epsilon, and long-float-epsilon is the smallest positive float <EPSILON> of the given format, such that the following expression is true when evaluated 
-(not (= (float 1 <EPSILON>) (+ (float 1 <EPSILON>) <EPSILON>))) 
-The value of each of the constants short-float-negative-epsilon, single-float-negative-epsilon, double-float-negative-epsilon, and long-float-negative-epsilon is the smallest positive float <EPSILON> of the given format, such that the following expression is true when evaluated 
-(not (= (float 1 <EPSILON>) (- (float 1 <EPSILON>) <EPSILON>))) 
-Examples None.
