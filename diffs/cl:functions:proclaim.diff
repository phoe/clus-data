 Arguments and Values

 declaration-specifier - a declaration specifier.
 Description

 Establishes the declaration specified by declaration-specifier in the global environment.
 Such a declaration, sometimes called a global declaration or a proclamation, is always in force unless locally shadowed.
 Names of variables and functions within declaration-specifier refer to dynamic variables and global function definitions, respectively.
-The next figure shows a list of declaration identifiers that can be used with proclaim.

-declaration  inline     optimize  type
-ftype        notinline  special

 An implementation is free to support other (implementation-defined) declaration identifiers as well.

 Notes

 Although the execution of a proclaim form has effects that might affect compilation, the compiler does not make any attempt to recognize and specially process proclaim forms. A proclamation such as the following, even if a top level form, does not have any effect until it is executed

 (proclaim '(special *x*))

-<TT>
 If compile time side effects are desired, eval-when may be useful. For example

  (eval-when (execute compile-toplevel load-toplevel)
    (proclaim '(special *x*)))

 In most such cases, however, it is preferrable to use declaim for this purpose.
  Since proclaim forms are ordinary function forms, macro forms can expand into them.
