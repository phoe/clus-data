 Arguments and Values

  packages-to-use - a designator for a list of package designators. The KEYWORD package may not be supplied. 
+
 package - a package designator. The default is the current package. The package cannot be the KEYWORD package.

 Description
  
+
 use-package causes package to inherit all the external symbols of packages-to-use. The inherited symbols become accessible as internal symbols of package. 
-Packages-to-use are added to the use list of package if they are not there already. All external symbols in packages-to-use become accessible in package as internal symbols. use-package does not cause any new symbols to be present in package but only makes them accessible by inheritance. 
-use-package checks for name conflicts between the newly imported symbols and those already accessible in package. A name conflict in use-package between two external symbols inherited by package from packages-to-use may be resolved in favor of either symbol by importing one of them into package and making it a shadowing symbol.

 Notes
  
+
 It is permissible for a package P1 to use a package P2 even if P2 already uses P1. The using of packages is not transitive, so no problem results from the apparent circularity.
