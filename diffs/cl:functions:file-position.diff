 Arguments and Values
  
+
 stream - a stream. 
+
 position-spec - a file position designator. 
+
 position - a file position or nil. 
+
 success-p - a generalized boolean. 
+
+
+
 Description
  
+
 Returns or changes the current position within a stream. 
+
+
 When position-spec is not supplied, file-position returns the current file position in the stream, or nil if this cannot be determined. 
+
+
 When position-spec is supplied, the file position in stream is set to that file position (if possible). file-position returns true if the repositioning is performed successfully, or false if it is not. 
+
+
 An integer returned by file-position of one argument should be acceptable as position-spec for use with the same file. 
-For a character file, performing a single read-char or write-char operation may cause the file position to be increased by more than 1 because of character-set translations (such as translating between the Common Lisp f#\Newline character and an external ASCII carriage-return/line-feed sequence) and other aspects of the implementation. For a binary file, every read-byte or write-byte operation increases the file position by 1.

 Side Effects
  
+
 When the position-spec argument is supplied, the file position in the stream might be moved. 
+
+
 Affected By
  
+
 The value returned by file-position increases monotonically as input or output operations are performed. 
+
+
 Exceptional Situations
  
+
 If position-spec is supplied, but is too large or otherwise inappropriate, an error is signaled.

 Notes
  
-Implementations that have character files represented as a sequence of records of bounded size might choose to encode the file position as, for example, <<record-number>>*<<max-record-size>>+<<character-within-record>>. This is a valid encoding because it increases monotonically as each character is read or written, though not necessarily by 1 at each step. An integer might then be considered ``inappropriate'' as position-spec to file-position if, when decoded into record number and character number, it turned out that the supplied record was too short for the specified character number.
\ No newline at end of file
