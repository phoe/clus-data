 Notes
  
-break is used as a way of inserting temporary debugging ``breakpoints'' in a program, not as a way of signaling errors. For this reason, break does not take the continue-format-control argument that cerror takes. This and the lack of any possibility of interception by condition handling are the only program-visible differences between break and cerror.

 The user interface aspects of break and cerror are permitted to vary more widely, in order to accomodate the interface needs of the implementation. For example, it is permissible for a Lisp read-eval-print loop to be entered by break rather than the conventional debugger.
