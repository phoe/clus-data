 Notes
- If end-test-form is nil, the test will never succeed. This provides an idiom for ``do forever'' the body of the do or do* is executed repeatedly. The infinite loop can be terminated by the use of return, return-from, go to an outer level, or throw.

 A do form may be explained in terms of the more primitive forms block, return, let, loop, tagbody, and psetq as follows
