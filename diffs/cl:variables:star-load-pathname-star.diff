 Variable *LOAD-PATHNAME*, *LOAD-TRUENAME*  
+
+
 Value Type
  
+
 The value of *load-pathname* must always be a pathname or nil. The value of *load-truename* must always be a physical pathname or nil. 
+
+
 Initial Value
  
+
 nil. 
+
+
 Description
  
+
 During a call to load, *load-pathname* is bound to the pathname denoted by the the first argument to load, merged against the defaults; that is, it is bound to (pathname (merge-pathnames filespec)). During the same time interval, *load-truename* is bound to the truename of the file being loaded. 
+
+
 At other times, the value of these variables is nil. 
+
+
 If a break loop is entered while load is ongoing, it is implementation-dependent whether these variables retain the values they had just prior to entering the break loop or whether they are bound to nil. 
+
+
 The consequences are unspecified if an attempt is made to assign or bind either of these variables.
