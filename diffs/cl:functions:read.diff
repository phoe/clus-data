 Arguments and Values

 input-stream - an input stream designator.
 eof-error-p - a generalized boolean. The default is true.
  eof-value - an object.  The default is nil.
 recursive-p - a generalized boolean. The default is false.
 object - an object (parsed by the Lisp reader) or the eof-value.
 Description

 read parses the printed representation of an object from input-stream and builds such an object.
-read-preserving-whitespace is like read but preserves any whitespace[2] character that delimits the printed representation of the object. read-preserving-whitespace is exactly like read when the recursive-p argument to read-preserving-whitespace is true.
-When *read-suppress* is false, read throws away the delimiting character required by certain printed representations if it is a whitespace[2] character; but read preserves the character (using unread-char) if it is syntactically meaningful, because it could be the start of the next expression.
-If a file ends in a symbol or a number immediately followed by an end of file[1], read reads the symbol or number successfully; when called again, it sees the end of file[1] and only then acts according to eof-error-p. If a file contains ignorable text at the end, such as blank lines and comments, read does not consider it to end in the middle of an object.

 If recursive-p is true, the call to read is expected to be made from within some function that itself has been called from read or from a similar input function, rather than from the top level.
  Both functions return the object read from input-stream. Eof-value is returned if eof-error-p is false and end of file is reached before the beginning of an object.

 Exceptional Situations

 read signals an error of type end-of-file, regardless of eof-error-p, if the file ends in the middle of an object representation. For example, if a file does not contain enough right parentheses to balance the left parentheses in it, read signals an error. This is detected when read or read-preserving-whitespace is called with recursive-p and eof-error-p non-nil, and end-of-file is reached before the beginning of an object.
 If eof-error-p is true, an error of type end-of-file is signaled at the end of file.
