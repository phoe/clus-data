 Variable *DEBUGGER-HOOK* 
 Value Type
  
-a designator for a function of two arguments (a condition and the value of *debugger-hook* at the time the debugger was entered), or nil. 
+a designator for a function of two arguments (a condition and the [CLGlossaryvalue]] of *debugger-hook* at the time the debugger was entered), or nil.
 Initial Value
  
 nil. 
 Description
  
 When the value of *debugger-hook* is non-nil, it is called prior to normal entry into the debugger, either due to a call to invoke-debugger or due to automatic entry into the debugger from a call to error or cerror with a condition that is not handled. The function may either handle the condition (transfer control) or return normally (allowing the standard debugger to run). To minimize recursive errors while debugging, *debugger-hook* is bound to nil by invoke-debugger prior to calling the function.
