+Syntax
+list &rest objects → list
+list* &rest objects+ → result
+Arguments and Values
+ object - an object.
+ list - a list.
+ result - an object.
+Description
+list returns a list containing the supplied objects.
+list* is like list except that the last argument to list becomes the car of the last cons constructed, while the last argument to list* becomes the cdr of the last cons constructed. Hence, any given call to list* always produces one fewer conses than a call to list with the same number of arguments.
+If the last argument to list* is a list, the effect is to construct a new list which is similar, but which has additional elements added to the front corresponding to the preceding arguments of list*.
+If list* receives only one object, that object is returned, regardless of whether or not it is a list.
