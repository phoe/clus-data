 Constant Variable PI 
 Value
  
 an implementation-dependent long float. 
 Description
  
-The best long float approximation to the mathematical constant <PI>. 
+The best long float approximation to the mathematical constant π.
 Examples
  
 
- ;; In each of the following computations, the precision depends 
- ;; on the implementation.  Also, if `long float' is treated by 
- ;; the implementation as equivalent to some other float format 
- ;; (e.g., `double float') the exponent marker might be the marker
- ;; for that equivalent (e.g., `D' instead of `L').
- pi =>  3.141592653589793L0
- (cos pi) =>  -1.0L0

 Notes
  
-An approximation to <PI> in some other precision can be obtained by writing (float pi x), where x is a float of the desired precision, or by writing (coerce pi type), where type is the desired type, such as short-float.
