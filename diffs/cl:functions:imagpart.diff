 real - a real. 
 Description
  
-realpart and imagpart return the real and imaginary parts of number respectively. If number is  real,  then realpart returns number and imagpart returns (* 0 number), which has the effect that the imaginary part of a rational is 0 and that of a float is a floating-point zero of the same format.
