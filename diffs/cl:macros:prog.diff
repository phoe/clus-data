-<TT> 
 For prog, init-forms are evaluated first, in the order in which they are supplied. The vars are then bound to the corresponding values in parallel. If no init-form is supplied for a given var, that var is bound to nil. 
 The body of prog is executed as if it were a tagbody form; the go statement can be used to transfer control to a tag. Tags label statements. 
 prog implicitly establishes a block named nil around the entire prog form, so that return can be used at any time to exit from the prog form. 
 The difference between prog* and prog is that in prog* the binding and initialization of the vars is done sequentially, so that the init-form for each one can use the values of previous ones.

 Notes
  prog can be explained in terms of block, let, and tagbody as follows 
 
  (prog variable-list declaration . body)
-    ==  (block nil (let variable-list declaration (tagbody . body)))
