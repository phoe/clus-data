+Syntax
  
-object - an object. 
-array - a generalized boolean. 
-base - a radix. 
-case - a symbol of type (member upcase downcase capitalize). 
-circle - a generalized boolean. 
-escape - a generalized boolean. 
-gensym - a generalized boolean. 
-length - a non-negative integer, or nil. 
-level - a non-negative integer, or nil. 
-lines - a non-negative integer, or nil. 
-miser-width - a non-negative integer, or nil. 
-pprint-dispatch - a pprint dispatch table. 
-pretty - a generalized boolean. 
-radix - a generalized boolean. 
-readably - a generalized boolean. 
-right-margin - a non-negative integer, or nil.  
-string - a string. 
-Description
  
-write-to-string, prin1-to-string, and princ-to-string are used to create a string consisting of the printed representation of object. Object is effectively printed as if by write, prin1, or princ, respectively, and the characters that would be output are made into a string.

+====Description====
+write-to-string, prin1-to-string, and princ-to-string are used to create a string consisting of the printed representation of object.
+object is effectively printed as if by write, prin1, or princ, respectively, and the characters that would be output are made into a string.
 write-to-string is the general output function. It has the ability to specify all the parameters applicable to the printing of object. 
 prin1-to-string acts like write-to-string with escape t, that is, escape characters are written where appropriate. 
 princ-to-string acts like write-to-string with  escape nil readably nil.  Thus no escape characters are written. 
 All other keywords that would be specified to write-to-string are default values when prin1-to-string or princ-to-string is invoked. 
 The meanings and defaults for the keyword arguments to write-to-string are the same as those for write.
