+ pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted → nil
+Arguments and Values
+None.
  
-Arguments and Values None.
  
 Description
  
-Tests whether or not the list passed to the lexically current logical block has been exhausted; see Section 22.2.1.1 (Dynamic Control of the Arrangement of Output). If this list has been reduced to nil, pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted terminates the execution of the lexically current logical block except for the printing of the suffix. Otherwise pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted returns nil.

Otherwise pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted returns nil.
  Whether or not pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted is fbound in the global environment is implementation-dependent; however, the restrictions on redefinition and shadowing of pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted are the same as for symbols in the COMMON-LISP package which are fbound in the global environment. The consequences of attempting to use pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted outside of pprint-logical-block are undefined.  
-Examples None.
  
-Side Effects None.

+Side Effects

+Affected By
+None.
  
 Exceptional Situations
  
-An error is signaled (at macro expansion time or at run time) if pprint-exit-if-list-exhausted is used anywhere other than lexically within a call on pprint-logical-block. Also, the consequences of executing pprint-if-list-exhausted outside of the dynamic extent of the pprint-logical-block which lexically contains it are undefined.
