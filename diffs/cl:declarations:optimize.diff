 Declaration OPTIMIZE
 Syntax

 (optimize {quality | (quality value)}*)
 Arguments

 quality - an optimize quality.
 value - one of the integers 0, 1, 2, or 3.
 Valid Context

 declaration or proclamation
-Binding Types Affected None.
+Binding Types Affected
+None.

 Description

-Advises the compiler that each quality should be given attention according to the specified corresponding value. Each quality must be a symbol naming an optimize quality; the names and meanings of the standard optimize qualities are shown in the next figure.

### Last words are diffrent
 Name               Meaning
 compilation-speed  speed of the compilation process
 debug              ease of debugging
 safety             run-time error checking
 space              both code size and run-time space
 speed              speed of the object code

-Figure 3-25.  Optimize qualities
### Line above missing
 There may be other, implementation-defined optimize qualities.
 A value 0 means that the corresponding quality is totally unimportant, and 3 that the quality is extremely important; 1 and 2 are intermediate values, with 1 the neutral value. (quality 3) can be abbreviated to quality.
 Note that code which has the optimization (safety 3), or just safety, is called safe code.
 The consequences are unspecified if a quality appears more than once with different values.
