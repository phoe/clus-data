 slot-missing (class t) object slot-name operation &optional new-value
  
 Arguments and Values
  
 class - the class of object. 
 object - an object. 
 slot-name - a symbol (the name of a would-be slot). 
 operation - one of the symbols setf, slot-boundp, slot-makunbound, or slot-value. 
 new-value - an object. 
 result - an object. 
 Description
  
 The generic function slot-missing is invoked when an attempt is made to access a slot in an object whose metaclass is standard-class and the slot of the name slot-name is not a name of a slot in that class. The default method signals an error. 
 The generic function slot-missing is not intended to be called by programmers. Programmers may write methods for it. 
 The generic function slot-missing may be called during evaluation of slot-value, (setf slot-value), slot-boundp, and slot-makunbound. For each of these operations the corresponding symbol for the operation argument is slot-value, setf, slot-boundp, and slot-makunbound respectively. 
 The optional new-value argument to slot-missing is used when the operation is attempting to set the value of the slot. 
  If slot-missing returns, its values will be treated as follows 
   If the operation is setf or slot-makunbound, any values will be ignored by the caller. 
   If the operation is slot-value, only the primary value will be used by the caller, and all other values will be ignored. 
   If the operation is slot-boundp, any boolean equivalent of the primary value of the method might be is used, and all other values will be ignored.

 Notes
  
 The set of arguments (including the class of the instance) facilitates defining methods on the metaclass for slot-missing.
