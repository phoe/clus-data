+Syntax
+ error datum &rest arguments
+Arguments and Values
+ datum, arguments - designators for a condition of default type simple-error.
+Description
+error effectively invokes signal on the denoted condition.
+If the condition is not handled, (invoke-debugger condition) is done. As a consequence of calling invoke-debugger, error cannot directly return; the only exit from error can come by non-local transfer of control in a handler or by use of an interactive debugging command.
+Examples
+(defun factorial (x) 
+  (cond ((or (not (typep x 'integer)) 
+             (minusp x)) 
+         (error "~S is not a valid argument to FACTORIAL." x))
+        ((zerop x) 1)
+        (t (*] x (factorial ([[CLFunctionsmath-one-minus|1- x)))))) 
+→
+FACTORIAL
+(factorial 20) 
+→
+2432902008176640000 
+(factorial -1)
+✖
+Error -1 is not a valid argument to FACTORIAL.
+To continue, type CONTINUE followed by an option number
+1 Return to Lisp Toplevel.
+Debug> 
+(defparameter *a* 'fred) 
+→
+*A*
+(if (numberp *a*) 
+    (1+ *a*) 
+    (error "~S is not a number." *a*))
+✖
+Error FRED is not a number.
+To continue, type CONTINUE followed by an option number
+1 Return to Lisp Toplevel.
+Debug> continue 1
+Return to Lisp Toplevel.
+(define-condition not-a-number (error)
+    ((argument reader not-a-number-argument 
+               initarg argument)) 
+  (report (lambda (condition stream) 
+             (format stream "~S is not a number."
+                     (not-a-number-argument condition))))) 
+→
+NOT-A-NUMBER
+(if (numberp *a*) 
+    (1+ *a*) 
+    (error "~S is not a number." *a*))
+✖
+Error FRED is not a number.
+To continue, type CONTINUE followed by an option number
+1 Return to Lisp Toplevel.
+Debug> continue 1
+Return to Lisp Toplevel.
+Side Effects
+Handlers for the specified condition, if any, are invoked and might have side effects. Program execution might stop, and the debugger might be entered.
+Affected By
+Existing handler bindings.
+*break-on-signals*
+Exceptional Situations
+None.
+Signals an error of type type-error if datum and arguments are not designators for a condition.

+Notes
+Some implementations may provide debugger commands for interactively returning from individual stack frames. However, it should be possible for the programmer to feel confident about writing code like
+(defun wargamesno-win-scenario () 
+  (if (error "pushing the button would be stupid.")) 
+      (push-the-button))
+In this scenario, there should be no chance that error will return and the button will get pushed.
+While the meaning of this program is clear and it might be proven `safe' by a formal theorem prover, such a proof is no guarantee that the program is safe to execute. Compilers have been known to have bugs, computers to have signal glitches, and human beings to manually intervene in ways that are not always possible to predict. Those kinds of errors, while beyond the scope of the condition system to formally model, are not beyond the scope of things that should seriously be considered when writing code that could have the kinds of sweeping effects hinted at by this example.
