+Value Type
+an object.
+Initial Value
+implementation-dependent.
+Description
+The variables *, **, and *** are maintained by the Lisp read-eval-print loop to save the values of results that are printed each time through the loop.
+The value of * is the most recent primary value that was printed, the value of ** is the previous value of *, and the value of *** is the previous value of **.
+If several values are produced, * contains the first value only; * contains nil if zero values are produced.
+The values of *, **, and *** are updated immediately prior to printing the return value of a top-level form by the Lisp read-eval-print loop. If the evaluation of such a form is aborted prior to its normal return, the values of *, **, and *** are not updated.
