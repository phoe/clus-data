 Arguments and Values
  
+
 char - a character. 
+
 input-stream - an input stream designator. The default is standard input. 
+
 recursive-p - a generalized boolean. The default is false. 
+
 list - a list of the objects read. 
+
+
+
 Description
  
-read-delimited-list reads objects from input-stream until the next character after an object's representation (ignoring whitespace[2] characters and comments) is char. 
-read-delimited-list looks ahead at each step for the next non-whitespace[2] character and peeks at it as if with peek-char. If it is char, then the character is consumed and the list of objects is returned. If it is a constituent or escape character, then read is used to read an object, which is added to the end of the list. If it is a macro character, its reader macro function is called; if the function returns a value, that value is added to the list. The peek-ahead process is then repeated.

 If recursive-p is true, this call is expected to be embedded in a higher-level call to read or a similar function.

 It is an error to reach end-of-file during the operation of read-delimited-list. 
-The consequences are undefined if char has a syntax type of whitespace[2] in the current readtable.

-<TT> This can be done by specifying a macro-character definition for #{ that does two things reads in all the items up to the }, and constructs the pairs. read-delimited-list performs the first task.

 It is necessary here to give a definition to the character } as well to prevent it from being a constituent. If the line

-<TT> would be considered a constituent character, part of the symbol named a}. This could be corrected by putting a space before the }, but it is better to call set-macro-character.

+

 Giving } the same definition as the standard definition of the character ) has the twin benefit of making it terminate tokens for use with read-delimited-list and also making it invalid for use in any other context. Attempting to read a stray } will signal an error.

 Notes
  
+
 read-delimited-list is intended for use in implementing reader macros. Usually it is desirable for char to be a terminating macro character so that it can be used to delimit tokens; however, read-delimited-list makes no attempt to alter the syntax specified for char by the current readtable. The caller must make any necessary changes to the readtable syntax explicitly.
