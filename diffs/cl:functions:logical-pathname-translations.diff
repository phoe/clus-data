 (setf (logical-pathname-translations host) new-translations)
  
 Arguments and Values
  
 host--a logical host designator. 
 translations, new-translations - a list. 
 Description
  
 Returns the host's list of translations. Each translation is a list of at least two elements from-wildcard and to-wildcard. Any additional elements are implementation-defined. From-wildcard is a logical pathname whose host is host. To-wildcard is a pathname.  
 (setf (logical-pathname-translations host) translations) sets a logical pathname host's list of translations. If host is a string that has not been previously used as a logical pathname host, a new logical pathname host is defined; otherwise an existing host's translations are replaced. logical pathname host names are compared with string-equal. 
- When setting the translations list, each from-wildcard can be a logical pathname whose host is host or a logical pathname namestring parseable by (parse-namestring string<A> host), where host represents the appropriate object as defined by parse-namestring. Each to-wildcard can be anything coercible to a pathname by (pathname to-wildcard). If to-wildcard coerces to a logical pathname, translate-logical-pathname will perform repeated translation steps when it uses it.

 host is either the host component of a logical pathname or a string that has been defined as a logical pathname host name by setf of logical-pathname-translations.

 Examples
  
  
+The top-level calls to setf in following examples have their return values omitted for readability.
+A very simple example of setting up a logical pathname host. No translations are necessary to get around file system restrictions, so all that is necessary is to specify the root of the physical directory tree that contains the logical file system. The namestring syntax on the right-hand side is implementation-dependent.
