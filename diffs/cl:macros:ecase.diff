 Arguments and Values
  
 keyform - a form; evaluated to produce a test-key. 
 keyplace - a form; evaluated initially to produce a test-key. Possibly also used later as a place if no keys match. 
 test-key - an object produced by evaluating keyform or keyplace. 
 keys - a designator for a list of objects. In the case of case, the symbols t and otherwise may not be used as the keys designator. To refer to these symbols by themselves as keys, the designators (t) and (otherwise), respectively, must be used instead. 
 forms - an implicit progn. 
 results - the values returned by the forms in the matching clause. 
 Description
  
 These macros allow the conditional execution of a body of forms in a clause that is selected by matching the test-key on the basis of its identity. 
 The keyform or keyplace is evaluated to produce the test-key. 
 Each of the normal-clauses is then considered in turn. If the test-key is the same as any key for that clause, the forms in that clause are evaluated as an implicit progn, and the values it returns are returned as the value of the case, ccase, or ecase form. 
 These macros differ only in their behavior when no normal-clause matches; specifically 
 
 case  
 If no normal-clause matches, and there is an otherwise-clause, then that otherwise-clause automatically matches; the forms in that clause are evaluated as an implicit progn, and the values it returns are returned as the value of the case. 
 If there is no otherwise-clause, case returns nil. 
 ccase  
-If no normal-clause matches, a correctable error of type type-error is signaled. The offending datum is the test-key and the expected type is type equivalent to (member key1 key2 ...). The store-value restart can be used to correct the error. 
-If the store-value restart is invoked, its argument becomes the new test-key, and is stored in keyplace as if by (setf keyplace test-key). Then ccase starts over, considering each clause anew.

  The subforms of keyplace might be evaluated again if none of the cases holds. 
 ecase  
 If no normal-clause matches, a non-correctable error of type type-error is signaled. The offending datum is the test-key and the expected type is type equivalent to (member key1 key2 ...). 
 Note that in contrast with ccase, the caller of ecase may rely on the fact that ecase does not return if a normal-clause does not match.

+The debugger might be entered. If the restart store-value is invoked, the value of keyplace might be changed.
 Affected By
  
 ccase and ecase, since they might signal an error, are potentially affected by existing handlers and *debug-io*. 
 Exceptional Situations
  
 ccase and ecase signal an error of type type-error if no normal-clause matches.

 The specific error message used by ecase and ccase can vary between implementations. In situations where control of the specific wording of the error message is important, it is better to use case with an otherwise-clause that explicitly signals an error with an appropriate message.
