 Arguments and Values

 number - a number.

 absolute-value - a non-negative real.

 Description
  
+
 abs returns the absolute value of number. 
+
+
 If number is  a real,  the result is of the same type as number. 
-If number is a complex, the result is a positive  real  with the same magnitude as number. The result can be a float even if number's components are rationals and an exact rational result would have been possible. Thus the result of (abs #c(3 4)) can be either 5 or 5.0, depending on the implementation.

 Notes
  
+
 If number is a complex, the result is equivalent to the following 
-(sqrt (+ (expt (realpart number) 2) (expt (imagpart number) 2))) 
+
+
+
+(abs number) ≡ (sqrt (+ (expt (realpart number) 2) (expt (imagpart number) 2)))
+
+
+
 An implementation should not use this formula directly for all complexes but should handle very large or very small components specially to avoid intermediate overflow or underflow.
