-colnum - a non-negative integer.
-colinc - a non-negative integer.
-stream - an output stream designator.

+pprint-tab kind colnum colinc &optional stream → nil
+====Arguments and Values====
+* kind - one of line, section, line-relative, or section-relative.
+* colnum - a non-negative integer.
+* colinc - a non-negative integer.
+* stream - an output stream designator.
+====Description====
+Specifies tabbing to stream as performed by the standard ~T.
+If stream is a pretty printing stream and the value of *print-pretty* is true, tabbing is performed; otherwise, pprint-tab has no effect.
 The arguments colnum and colinc correspond to the two parameters to ~T and are in terms of ems. The kind argument specifies the style of tabbing. It must be one of line (tab as by ~T), section (tab as by ~T, but measuring horizontal positions relative to the start of the dynamically enclosing section), line-relative (tab as by ~@T), or section-relative (tab as by ~@T, but measuring horizontal positions relative to the start of the dynamically enclosing section).
