\Thenextfigure\ lists some //[[CL:Glossary:defined names]]// that are applicable 
to //[[CL:Glossary:hash tables]]//.  The following rules apply to //[[CL:Glossary:hash tables]]//.



\beginlist
\itemitem{--}
A //[[CL:Glossary:hash table]]// can only associate one value with a given
key. If an attempt is made to add a second value for a given key,
the second value will replace the first.
Thus, adding a value to a //[[CL:Glossary:hash table]]// is a destructive operation;
the //[[CL:Glossary:hash table]]// is modified.  


\itemitem{--}
There are four kinds of //[[CL:Glossary:hash tables]]//:
  those whose keys are compared with **[[CL:Functions:eq]]**,
  those whose keys are compared with **[[CL:Functions:eql]]**,
  those whose keys are compared with **[[CL:Functions:equal]]**, and
\issue{HASH-TABLE-TESTS:ADD-EQUALP}
  those whose keys are compared with **[[CL:Functions:equalp]]**.  



\itemitem{--}
//[[CL:Glossary:Hash tables]]// are created by **[[CL:Functions:make-hash-table]]**. 
**[[CL:Functions:gethash]]** is used to look up a key and find the associated value.
New entries are added to //[[CL:Glossary:hash tables]]// using \macref{setf} with **[[CL:Functions:gethash]]**.
**[[CL:Functions:remhash]]** is used to remove an entry.
For example:

\code
 (setq a (make-hash-table)) \EV #<HASH-TABLE EQL 0/120 32536573>
 (setf (gethash 'color a) 'brown) \EV BROWN
 (setf (gethash 'name a) 'fred) \EV FRED
 (gethash 'color a) \EV BROWN, //[[CL:Glossary:true]]//
 (gethash 'name a) \EV FRED, //[[CL:Glossary:true]]//
 (gethash 'pointy a) \EV NIL, //[[CL:Glossary:false]]//
\endcode


In this example, the symbols \f{color} and \f{name} are being used as
keys, and the symbols \f{brown} and \f{fred} are being used as the
associated values.  The //[[CL:Glossary:hash table]]// 
has two items in it, one of which                              
associates from \f{color} to \f{brown}, and the other of which
associates from \f{name} to \f{fred}.


\itemitem{--}
A key or a value may be any //[[CL:Glossary:object]]//.

\issue{HASH-TABLE-SIZE:INTENDED-ENTRIES}

















\itemitem{--}



The existence of an entry in the //[[CL:Glossary:hash table]]// can be determined
from the //[[CL:Glossary:secondary value]]// returned by **[[CL:Functions:gethash]]**.

\issue{HASH-TABLE-KEY-MODIFICATION:SPECIFY}

The function supplied as the **'':test''** argument to **[[CL:Functions:make-hash-table]]**
specifies the `equivalence test' for the //[[CL:Glossary:hash table]]// it creates.
 
An //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// is `visibly modified' with regard to an equivalence test
if there exists some set of //[[CL:Glossary:objects]]// (or potential //[[CL:Glossary:objects]]//)
which are equivalent to the //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// before the modification but are
no longer equivalent afterwards.








If an //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// $O\sub 1$ is used as a key in a //[[CL:Glossary:hash table]]// $H$
and is then visibly modified with regard to the equivalence test of $H$,
then the consequences are unspecified if $O\sub 1$, or any //[[CL:Glossary:object]]//
$O\sub 2$ equivalent to $O\sub 1$ under the equivalence test (either before
or after the modification), is used as a key in further operations on $H$.
The consequences of using $O\sub 1$ as a key are unspecified 
even if $O\sub 1$ is visibly modified 
and then later modified again in such a way as 
to undo the visible modification.
 
Following are specifications of the modifications which are visible to the
equivalence tests which must be supported by //[[CL:Glossary:hash tables]]//.  The modifications
are described in terms of modification of components, and are defined
recursively.  Visible modifications of components of the //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// are 
visible modifications of the //[[CL:Glossary:object]]//.

\beginsubsubsection{Visible Modification of Objects with respect to EQ and EQL}
\DefineSection{VisModEQ}
\DefineSection{VisModEQL}

No //[[CL:Glossary:standardized]]// //[[CL:Glossary:function]]// is provided that is capable of visibly
modifying an //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// with regard to **[[CL:Functions:eq]]** or **[[CL:Functions:eql]]**.

\endsubsubsection%{Visible Modification of Objects with respect to EQ and EQL}

\beginsubsubsection{Visible Modification of Objects with respect to EQUAL}
\DefineSection{VisModEQUAL}

As a consequence of the behavior for **[[CL:Functions:equal]]**,
the rules for visible modification of //[[CL:Glossary:objects]]// not explicitly mentioned in this
section are inherited from those in \secref\VisModEQL.
 
\beginsubsubsubsection{Visible Modification of Conses with respect to EQUAL}

Any visible change to the //[[CL:Glossary:car]]// or the //[[CL:Glossary:cdr]]// of a //[[CL:Glossary:cons]]//
is considered a visible modification with regard to **[[CL:Functions:equal]]**.
 
\endsubsubsubsection%{Visible Modification of Conses with respect to EQUAL}

\beginsubsubsubsection{Visible Modification of Bit Vectors and Strings with respect to EQUAL}

For a //[[CL:Glossary:vector]]// \oftype{bit-vector} or \oftype{string}, any visible change
     to an //[[CL:Glossary:active]]// //[[CL:Glossary:element]]// of the //[[CL:Glossary:vector]]//,
  or to the //[[CL:Glossary:length]]// of the //[[CL:Glossary:vector]]// (if it is //[[CL:Glossary:actually adjustable]]// 
					           or has a //[[CL:Glossary:fill pointer]]//)
is considered a visible modification with regard to **[[CL:Functions:equal]]**.
 
\endsubsubsubsection%{Visible Modification of Bit Vectors and Strings with respect to EQUAL}

\endsubsubsection%{Visible Modification of Objects with respect to EQUAL}

\beginsubsubsection{Visible Modification of Objects with respect to EQUALP}

As a consequence of the behavior for **[[CL:Functions:equalp]]**,
the rules for visible modification of //[[CL:Glossary:objects]]// not explicitly mentioned in this
section are inherited from those in \secref\VisModEQUAL.

\beginsubsubsubsection{Visible Modification of Structures with respect to EQUALP}

Any visible change to a //[[CL:Glossary:slot]]// of a //[[CL:Glossary:structure]]//
is considered a visible modification with regard to **[[CL:Functions:equalp]]**.
 
\endsubsubsubsection%{Visible Modification of Structures with respect to EQUALP}
 
\beginsubsubsubsection{Visible Modification of Arrays with respect to EQUALP}

In an //[[CL:Glossary:array]]//, any visible change
     to an //[[CL:Glossary:active]]// //[[CL:Glossary:element]]//,
     to the //[[CL:Glossary:fill pointer]]// (if the //[[CL:Glossary:array]]// can and does have one),
  or to the //[[CL:Glossary:dimensions]]// (if the //[[CL:Glossary:array]]// is //[[CL:Glossary:actually adjustable]]//)
is considered a visible modification with regard to **[[CL:Functions:equalp]]**.

\endsubsubsubsection%{Visible Modification of Arrays with respect to EQUALP}

\beginsubsubsubsection{Visible Modification of Hash Tables with respect to EQUALP}
 
In a //[[CL:Glossary:hash table]]//, any visible change
     to the count of entries in the //[[CL:Glossary:hash table]]//,
     to the keys,
  or to the values associated with the keys
is considered a visible modification with regard to **[[CL:Functions:equalp]]**.

Note that the visibility of modifications to the keys depends on the equivalence test
of the //[[CL:Glossary:hash table]]//, not on the specification of **[[CL:Functions:equalp]]**.
 
\endsubsubsubsection%{Visible Modification of Hash Tables with respect to EQUALP}

\endsubsubsection%{Visible Modification of Objects with respect to EQUALP}

\beginsubsubsection{Visible Modifications by Language Extensions}

//[[CL:Glossary:Implementations]]// that extend the language by providing additional mutator
functions (or additional behavior for existing mutator functions) must
document how the use of these extensions interacts with equivalence tests and
//[[CL:Glossary:hash table]]// searches.
 
//[[CL:Glossary:Implementations]]// that extend the language by defining additional acceptable
equivalence tests for //[[CL:Glossary:hash tables]]// (allowing additional values for the **'':test''**
argument to **[[CL:Functions:make-hash-table]]**) must document the visible components of these
tests.
