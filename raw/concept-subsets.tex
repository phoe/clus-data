%%Language Subsets

\issue{SUBSETTING-POSITION:NONE}
The language described in this standard contains no subsets,
though subsets are not forbidden.
\endissue{SUBSETTING-POSITION:NONE}

For a language to be considered a subset,
it must have the property that any valid \term{program} in that language
has equivalent semantics and will run directly
(with no extralingual pre-processing, and no special compatibility packages)
in any \term{conforming implementation} of the full language.

A language that conforms to this requirement shall be described
as being a ``subset of \clisp\ as specified by ANSI \metavar{standard number}.''
