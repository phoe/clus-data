\DefineSection{PathnameComponents}










A //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]// has six components:
     a host,
     a device,
     a directory,
     a name,
     a type,
 and a version.





\beginsubsubsection{The Pathname Host Component}

The name of the file system on which the file resides,
or the name of a //[[CL:Glossary:logical host]]//.



\endsubsubsection%{The Pathname Host Component}

\beginsubsubsection{The Pathname Device Component}

Corresponds to the ``device'' or ``file structure'' concept in many
host file systems: the name of a logical or physical device containing files.



\endsubsubsection%{The Pathname Device Component}


\beginsubsubsection{The Pathname Directory Component}

Corresponds to the ``directory'' concept in many host file systems:
the name of a group of related files.



\endsubsubsection%{The Pathname Directory Component}


\beginsubsubsection{The Pathname Name Component}

The ``name'' part of a group of //[[CL:Glossary:files]]// that can be thought of
as conceptually related.



\endsubsubsection%{The Pathname Name Component}



\beginsubsubsection{The Pathname Type Component}

Corresponds to the ``filetype'' or ``extension'' concept in many host
file systems.  This says what kind of file this is.  
This component is always a //[[CL:Glossary:string]]//, \nil, **'':wild''**, or **'':unspecific''**.



\endsubsubsection%{The Pathname Type Component}



\beginsubsubsection{The Pathname Version Component}

Corresponds to the ``version number'' concept in many host file systems.

The version is either a positive //[[CL:Glossary:integer]]// 
or a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]// from the following list:
\nil, **'':wild''**, **'':unspecific''**, or **'':newest''**
(refers to the largest version number that already exists in 
the file system when reading a file, or to
a version number
greater than any already existing in the file system
when writing a new file).  Implementations 
can define other special version //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]//.

separation between //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]// fields, 
such as //[[CL:Glossary:slash]]// in \Unix\ //[[CL:Glossary:filenames]]//.
Whether separator //[[CL:Glossary:characters]]// are permitted as 
part of a //[[CL:Glossary:string]]// in a //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]// component
is //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-defined]]//; 
however, if the //[[CL:Glossary:implementation]]// does permit it, 
it must arrange to properly ``quote'' the character for the 
//[[CL:Glossary:file system]]// when constructing a //[[CL:Glossary:namestring]]//.
For example,

\code
 ;; In a TOPS-20 implementation, which uses {\hat}V to quote 
 (NAMESTRING (MAKE-PATHNAME :HOST "OZ" :NAME "<TEST>"))
\EV #P"OZ:PS:{\hat}V<TEST{\hat}V>"

For the functions in \figref\PathnameCaseFuns,
a value of **'':local''**\idxkwd{local} for the **'':case''** argument

convention for //[[CL:Glossary:case]]//.

If the //[[CL:Glossary:file system]]// supports both //[[CL:Glossary:cases]]//, //[[CL:Glossary:strings]]// given or received
as //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]// component values under this protocol are to be used exactly

For the functions in \figref\PathnameCaseFuns,
a value of **'':common''**\idxkwd{common} for the **'':case''** argument 
that these //[[CL:Glossary:functions]]// should receive

The value of any //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]// component can be \nil.

If **'':wild''**\idxkwd{wild} is the value of a //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]// component,
that component is considered to be a wildcard, which matches anything.

A //[[CL:Glossary:conforming program]]// must be prepared to encounter a value of **'':wild''**
as the value of any //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]// component,
or as an //[[CL:Glossary:element]]// of a //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// that is the value of the directory component.

\issue{PATHNAME-SUBDIRECTORY-LIST:NEW-REPRESENTATION}
When constructing a //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]//,
a //[[CL:Glossary:conforming program]]// may use **'':wild''** as the value of any or all of

or device component.

If **'':wild''** is used as the value of the directory component in the construction
of a //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]//, the effect is equivalent to specifying the list
\f{(:absolute :wild-inferiors)},
or the same as \f{(:absolute :wild)} in a //[[CL:Glossary:file system]]// that does not support

If **'':unspecific''**\idxkwd{unspecific} is the value of a //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]// component,
the component is considered to be ``absent'' 

or to ``have no meaning''
in the //[[CL:Glossary:filename]]// being represented by the //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]//.

Whether a value of **'':unspecific''** is permitted for any component
on any given //[[CL:Glossary:file system]]// accessible to the //[[CL:Glossary:implementation]]//
is //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-defined]]//.
A //[[CL:Glossary:conforming program]]// must never unconditionally use a
**'':unspecific''** as the value of a //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]// component because
such a value is not guaranteed to be permissible in all implementations.
However, a //[[CL:Glossary:conforming program]]// can, if it is careful, 
successfully manipulate user-supplied data 
which contains or refers to non-portable //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]// components.
And certainly a //[[CL:Glossary:conforming program]]// should be prepared for the

If a //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]// is converted to a //[[CL:Glossary:namestring]]//,

However, when merging a //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]// with a set of defaults,
only a \nil\ value for a component

\beginsubsubsubsection{Restrictions on Examining a Pathname Directory Component}



The directory might be a //[[CL:Glossary:string]]//,







**'':wild''**, **'':unspecific''**, or \nil.

The directory can be a //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// of //[[CL:Glossary:strings]]// and //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]//. 
\issue{PATHNAME-SUBDIRECTORY-LIST:NEW-REPRESENTATION}
The //[[CL:Glossary:car]]// of the //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// is one of the symbols **'':absolute''**\idxkwd{absolute} or

\beginlist

\item{**'':absolute''**}

  A //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// whose //[[CL:Glossary:car]]// is the symbol **'':absolute''** represents 
  a directory path starting from the root directory.  The list 
  \f{(:absolute)} represents the root directory.  The list 
  \f{(:absolute "foo" "bar" "baz")} represents the directory called
  \f{"/foo/bar/baz"} in Unix (except possibly for //[[CL:Glossary:case]]//).
 
\item{**'':relative''**}

  A //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// whose //[[CL:Glossary:car]]// is the symbol **'':relative''** represents 
  a directory path starting from a default directory.  
  The list \f{(:relative)} has the same meaning as \nil\ and hence is not used.
  The list {\tt (:relative "foo" "bar")} represents the directory named {\tt "bar"} 
  in the directory named {\tt "foo"} in the default directory.

\endlist

Each remaining element of the //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// is a //[[CL:Glossary:string]]// or a //[[CL:Glossary:symbol]]//.

Each //[[CL:Glossary:string]]// names a single level of directory structure.
The //[[CL:Glossary:strings]]// should contain only the directory names 
themselves---no punctuation characters.

In place of a //[[CL:Glossary:string]]//, at any point in the //[[CL:Glossary:list]]//, //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]// 
can occur to indicate special file notations.
\Thenextfigure\ lists the //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]// that have standard meanings.

of any //[[CL:Glossary:type]]// that is disjoint from \typeref{string}
if necessary to represent features of their file systems that cannot be

Supplying any non-//[[CL:Glossary:string]]//, including any of the //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]// listed below,

signals an error \oftype{file-error}.

The following notes apply to the previous figure:

\beginlist
\item{Invalid Combinations}

Using **'':absolute''** or **'':wild-inferiors''** 
immediately followed by **'':up''** or **'':back''**
signals an error \oftype{file-error}.
 
\item{Syntactic vs Semantic}

``Syntactic'' means that the action of **'':back''** 
depends only on the //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]//
and not on the contents of the file system.  

``Semantic'' means that the action of **'':up''** 
depends on the contents of the file system; 
to resolve a //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]// containing 
**'':up''** to a //[[CL:Glossary:pathname]]// whose directory component
contains only **'':absolute''** and 
//[[CL:Glossary:strings]]// requires probing the file system.

**'':up''** differs from 
**'':back''** only in file systems that support multiple
  names for directories, perhaps via symbolic links.  For example,
  suppose that there is a directory
\f{(:absolute "X" "Y" "Z")}
  linked to 
\f{(:absolute "A" "B" "C")}
  and there also exist directories
\f{(:absolute "A" "B" "Q")} and 
\f{(:absolute "X" "Y" "Q")}.
Then
\f{(:absolute "X" "Y" "Z" :up "Q")}
  designates
\f{(:absolute "A" "B" "Q")}
  while
\f{(:absolute "X" "Y" "Z" :back "Q")}
  designates
\f{(:absolute "X" "Y" "Q")}
