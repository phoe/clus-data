If the reader encounters a //[[CL:Glossary:macro character]]//,
then its associated //[[CL:Glossary:reader macro function]]// 
is invoked and may produce an //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// to be returned.
This //[[CL:Glossary:function]]// may read the //[[CL:Glossary:characters]]// 
following the //[[CL:Glossary:macro character]]// in the //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// 
in any syntax and return the //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// represented by that syntax.


Any //[[CL:Glossary:character]]// can be made to be a //[[CL:Glossary:macro character]]//.
The //[[CL:Glossary:macro characters]]// defined initially in a //[[CL:Glossary:conforming implementation]]//
include
the following:

\beginsubsection{Left-Parenthesis}
\DefineSection{LeftParen}\idxcode{(}\idxtext{Left-Parenthesis (reader macro)}\idxref{list}




The //[[CL:Glossary:left-parenthesis]]// initiates reading of a //[[CL:Glossary:list]]//.
**[[CL:Functions:read]]** is called recursively to read successive //[[CL:Glossary:objects]]//
until a right parenthesis is found in the input //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]//.
A //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// of the //[[CL:Glossary:objects]]// read is returned.  Thus

\code
 (a b c)
\endcode
is read as a //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// of three //[[CL:Glossary:objects]]//
(the //[[CL:Glossary:symbols]]// \f{a}, \f{b}, and \f{c}).
The right parenthesis need not immediately follow the printed representation of
the last //[[CL:Glossary:object]]//; //[[CL:Glossary:whitespace]]//\meaning{2}                              
characters and comments may precede it.











If no //[[CL:Glossary:objects]]// precede the right parenthesis, 
it reads as a //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// of zero //[[CL:Glossary:objects]]// 
(the //[[CL:Glossary:empty list]]//).


If a //[[CL:Glossary:token]]// that is just a dot\idxterm{dot}\idxcode{.}
not immediately preceded by an escape character
is read after some //[[CL:Glossary:object]]//
then exactly one more //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// must follow the dot,
possibly preceded or followed by //[[CL:Glossary:whitespace]]//\meaning{2} or a comment,
followed by the right parenthesis:

\code
 (a b c . d)
\endcode
This means that the //[[CL:Glossary:cdr]]// of the last //[[CL:Glossary:cons]]// in the 
//[[CL:Glossary:list]]// is not \nil,
but rather the //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// whose representation followed the dot.
The above example might have been the result of evaluating

\code
 (cons 'a (cons 'b (cons 'c 'd)))
\endcode
Similarly,

\code
 (cons 'this-one 'that-one) \EV (this-one . that-one)
\endcode
It is permissible for the //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// 
following the dot to be a //[[CL:Glossary:list]]//:

\code
 (a b c d . (e f . (g))) \EQ (a b c d e f g)

\beginsubsubsection{Notes about Style for Semicolon}

Some text editors make assumptions about desired indentation based on
the number of //[[CL:Glossary:semicolons]]// that begin a comment.  The following style 
conventions are common, although not by any means universal.  

\beginsubsubsubsection{Use of Single Semicolon}



Comments that begin with a single //[[CL:Glossary:semicolon]]// are all aligned to 
the same column at the right (sometimes called the ``comment column'').
The text of such a comment generally applies only to the line on which it appears.
Occasionally two or three contain a single sentence together;
this is sometimes indicated by indenting all but the first with an additional
space (after the //[[CL:Glossary:semicolon]]//).

\endsubsubsubsection%{Use of Single Semicolon}

\beginsubsubsubsection{Use of Double Semicolon}



Comments that begin with a double //[[CL:Glossary:semicolon]]// are all aligned to
the same level of indentation as a //[[CL:Glossary:form]]// would be at that same
position in the //[[CL:Glossary:code]]//.



The text of such a comment usually describes
    the state of the //[[CL:Glossary:program]]// at the point where the comment occurs,
    the //[[CL:Glossary:code]]// which follows the comment,
 or both.

\endsubsubsubsection%{Use of Double Semicolon}

\beginsubsubsubsection{Use of Triple Semicolon}



Comments that begin with a triple //[[CL:Glossary:semicolon]]// are all aligned to
the left margin.  Usually they are used prior to a definition or set
of definitions, rather than within a definition.

\endsubsubsubsection%{Use of Triple Semicolon}



\beginsubsubsubsection{Use of Quadruple Semicolon}

Comments that begin with a quadruple //[[CL:Glossary:semicolon]]// are all aligned to
the left margin, and generally contain only a short piece of text that
serve as a title for the code which follows, and might be used in the
header or footer of a program that prepares code for presentation as 
a hardcopy document.

\b{Syntax:} \f{"\metaparam{text}"}




The //[[CL:Glossary:double-quote]]// is used to begin and end a //[[CL:Glossary:string]]//.
When a //[[CL:Glossary:double-quote]]// is encountered,
//[[CL:Glossary:characters]]// are read from the //[[CL:Glossary:input]]// //[[CL:Glossary:stream]]// 
and accumulated until another //[[CL:Glossary:double-quote]]// is encountered.
If a //[[CL:Glossary:single escape]]// //[[CL:Glossary:character]]// is seen,
the //[[CL:Glossary:single escape]]// //[[CL:Glossary:character]]// is discarded,
the next //[[CL:Glossary:character]]// is accumulated, and accumulation continues.

The accumulated //[[CL:Glossary:characters]]// 
up to but not including the matching //[[CL:Glossary:double-quote]]// 
are made into a //[[CL:Glossary:simple string]]// and returned.
\issue{CHARACTER-PROPOSAL:2-1-1}
It is //[[CL:Glossary:implementation-dependent]]//
which //[[CL:Glossary:attributes]]// of the accumulated characters are removed in this process.


Examples of the use of the //[[CL:Glossary:double-quote]]// character are in \thenextfigure. 

\showtwo{Examples of the use of double-quote}{
\f{"Foo"}                          & ;A string with three characters in it \cr

\f{"|x| = |-x|"}                   & ;A ten-character string \cr
}

Note that to place a single escape character or a //[[CL:Glossary:double-quote]]// into a string,
such a character must be preceded by a single escape character.
Note, too, that a multiple escape character need not be quoted by a 
single escape character within a string.

\endsubsection%{Double-Quote}

\beginsubsection{Backquote}
\DefineSection{Backquote}
\idxcode{`}\idxtext{Backquote (reader macro)}\idxtext{quotation (of forms)}
\idxref{quote}\idxref{list}\idxref{cons}



The //[[CL:Glossary:backquote]]// introduces a template of a data structure to be built.  
For example, writing

\code
 `(cond ((numberp ,x) ,@y) (t (print ,x) ,@y))
\endcode
is roughly equivalent to writing

\code
 (list 'cond 
       (cons (list 'numberp x) y) 
       (list* 't (list 'print x) y))
\endcode
Where a comma
occurs in the template, 
the //[[CL:Glossary:expression]]//
following the comma is to be evaluated to produce an //[[CL:Glossary:object]]// to
be inserted at that point.  Assume \f{b} has the value 3, for example, then
evaluating the //[[CL:Glossary:form]]// denoted by \f{`(a b ,b ,(+ b 1) b)} produces
the result \f{(a b 3 4 b)}.



If a comma is immediately followed by an //[[CL:Glossary:at-sign]]//, 
then the //[[CL:Glossary:form]]// following the //[[CL:Glossary:at-sign]]//
is evaluated to produce a //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// of //[[CL:Glossary:objects]]//.
These //[[CL:Glossary:objects]]// are then ``spliced'' into place in the template.  For
example, if \f{x} has the value \f{(a b c)}, then

\code
 `(x ,x ,@x foo ,(cadr x) bar ,(cdr x) baz ,@(cdr x))
\EV (x (a b c) a b c foo b bar (b c) baz b c)
\endcode

The backquote syntax can be summarized formally as follows.

\beginlist
\itemitem{\bull}
\f{`//basic//} is the same as \f{'//basic//},
that is, \f{(quote //basic//)}, for any //[[CL:Glossary:expression]]// 
//basic// that is not a //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// or a general //[[CL:Glossary:vector]]//.


\itemitem{\bull}
\f{`,//form//} is the same as //form//, for any //form//, provided
that the representation of //form// does not begin with //[[CL:Glossary:at-sign]]//
or //[[CL:Glossary:dot]]//.  (A similar caveat holds for all occurrences of a form after a //[[CL:Glossary:comma]]//.)


\itemitem{\bull}
\f{`,@//form//} has undefined consequences.


\itemitem{\bull}
\f{`(x1 x2 x3 ... xn . atom)}
may be interpreted to mean

\code
 (append \lbracket\ x1\rbracket \lbracket\ x2\rbracket \lbracket\ x3\rbracket ... \lbracket\ xn\rbracket (quote atom))
\endcode
where the brackets are used to indicate
a transformation of an //xj// as follows:


\beginlist
\itemitem{--}
\f{[//form//]} is interpreted as \f{(list `//form//)}, 
which contains a backquoted form that must then be further interpreted.


\itemitem{--}
\f{[,//form//]} is interpreted as \f{(list //form//)}.


\itemitem{--}
\f{[,@//form//]} is interpreted as //form//.
\endlist


\itemitem{\bull}
\f{`(x1 x2 x3 ... xn)} may be interpreted to mean
the same as the backquoted form
\f{`(x1 x2 x3 ... xn . \nil)},
thereby reducing it to the previous case.


\itemitem{\bull}
\f{`(x1 x2 x3 ... xn . ,form)} may be interpreted to mean

\code
 (append \lbracket\ x1\rbracket \lbracket\ x2\rbracket \lbracket\ x3\rbracket ... \lbracket\ xn\rbracket form)
\endcode
where the brackets indicate a transformation of an {\tt xj} as described above.


\itemitem{\bull}
\f{`(x1 x2 x3 ... xn . ,@form)} has undefined consequences.


\itemitem{\bull}
\f{`\#(x1 x2 x3 ... xn)} may be interpreted to mean
\f{(apply \#'vector `(x1 x2 x3 ... xn))}.
\endlist



Anywhere ``\f{,@}'' may be used, the syntax ``\f{,.}'' may be used instead
to indicate that it is permissible to operate //[[CL:Glossary:destructively]]// on 
the //[[CL:Glossary:list structure]]//  produced by the form following the ``\f{,.}'' 
(in effect, to use **[[CL:Functions:nconc]]** instead of **[[CL:Functions:append]]**).


If the backquote syntax is nested, the innermost backquoted form
should be expanded first.  This means that if several commas occur
in a row, the leftmost one belongs to the innermost //[[CL:Glossary:backquote]]//.














An //[[CL:Glossary:implementation]]// is free to interpret a backquoted //[[CL:Glossary:form]]// $F\sub 1$
as any //[[CL:Glossary:form]]// $F\sub 2$ that, when evaluated, will produce a result that is
the //[[CL:Glossary:same]]// under **[[CL:Functions:equal]]** as the result implied by the above definition, 
provided that the side-effect behavior of the substitute //[[CL:Glossary:form]]// $F\sub 2$ 
is also consistent with the description given above.

The constructed
copy of the template might or might not share //[[CL:Glossary:list]]// structure with the
template itself.  As an example, the above definition implies that

\code
 `((,a b) ,c ,@d)
\endcode
will be interpreted as if it were

\code
 (append (list (append (list a) (list 'b) '\nil)) (list c) d '\nil)
\endcode
but it could also be legitimately interpreted to mean any of the following:

\code
 (append (list (append (list a) (list 'b))) (list c) d)
 (append (list (append (list a) '(b))) (list c) d)
 (list* (cons a '(b)) c d)
 (list* (cons a (list 'b)) c d)
 (append (list (cons a '(b))) (list c) d)
 (list* (cons a '(b)) c (copy-list d))
\endcode
               
\beginsubsubsection{Notes about Backquote}

Since the exact manner in which the //[[CL:Glossary:Lisp reader]]// will parse
an //[[CL:Glossary:expression]]// involving the //[[CL:Glossary:backquote]]// //[[CL:Glossary:reader macro]]// 
is not specified, an //[[CL:Glossary:implementation]]// is free to choose any
representation that preserves the semantics described.

Often an //[[CL:Glossary:implementation]]// will choose a representation that facilitates
pretty printing of the expression, so that \f{(pprint `(a ,b))} will display
\f{`(a ,b)} and not, for example, \f{(list 'a b)}.  However, this is not a
requirement.

Implementors who have no particular reason to make one choice or another
might wish to refer to {\IEEEScheme}, which identifies a popular choice of
representation for such expressions that might provide useful to be useful
compatibility for some user communities.  There is no requirement, however,
that any //[[CL:Glossary:conforming implementation]]// use this particular representation.
This information is provided merely for cross-reference purposes.

//[[CL:Glossary:Sharpsign]]// is a //[[CL:Glossary:non-terminating]]// //[[CL:Glossary:dispatching macro character]]//.
It reads an optional

The //[[CL:Glossary:standard syntax]]// includes constructs introduced by the \f{\#} character.

a character that identifies the type of construct is 
followed by arguments in some form.
If the character is a letter, its //[[CL:Glossary:case]]// is not important;
\f{\#O} and \f{\#o} are considered to be equivalent, for example.


Certain \f{\#} constructs allow an unsigned decimal number to appear
between the \f{\#} and the character.

The combinations marked by an asterisk (*) are explicitly reserved to the

Note also that //[[CL:Glossary:digits]]// do not appear in the preceding table.  This is

Some text editors that purport to understand Lisp syntax treat any \f{|...|}
as balanced pairs that cannot nest (as if they were just balanced pairs of 
the multiple escapes used in notating certain symbols).  To compensate for 
this deficiency, some programmers use the notation \f{\#||...\#||...||\#...||\#}
instead of \f{\#|...\#|...|\#...|\#}.   Note that this alternate usage is not
a different //[[CL:Glossary:reader macro]]//; it merely exploits the fact that the additional
vertical-bars occur within the comment in a way that tricks certain text editor
into better supporting nested comments.  As such, one might sometimes see code
like:

\code
 #|| (+ #|| 3 ||# 4 5) ||#
