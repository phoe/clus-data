====== Function SLEEP ======

====Syntax====

**sleep** //seconds// → //**[[CL:Constant Variables:nil]]**//

====Arguments and Values====

//seconds// - a non-negative //[[CL:Glossary:real]]//.

====Description====

Causes execution to cease and become dormant for approximately the seconds of real time indicated by //seconds//, whereupon execution is resumed.

====Examples====

<blockquote> (sleep 1) → NIL

;; Actually, since SLEEP is permitted to use approximate timing, ;; this might not always yield true, but it will often enough that ;; we felt it to be a productive example of the intent. (let ((then (get-universal-time)) (now (progn (sleep 10) (get-universal-time)))) (>= (- now then) 10)) → //[[CL:Glossary:true]]// </blockquote>

====Side Effects====

Causes processing to pause.

====Affected By====

The granularity of the scheduler.

====Exceptional Situations====

Should signal an error of type type-error if //seconds// is not a non-negative //[[CL:Glossary:real]]//.

====See Also====

None.

====Notes====

None.
